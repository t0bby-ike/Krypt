	{"title":"EULA", "text": "EULA GhostVolt Trial and Subscription Agreement Please read this agreement carefully, in particular clauses 4 & 8 This Agreement is a legal agreement between GhostVolt Limited, a company incorporated in England (registration number 11207846) and whose registered office is at JFS Studios, Deptford Road, Gateshead, Tyne and Wear NE8 3AZ, (the Supplier) as the provider of the GhostVolt encryption software, as further described at https:\/\/ghostvolt.com\/, including any updates, modifications and new versions of the same (the Software) and its customers (each a Customer). By agreeing to the terms of this Agreement, starting a trial of the Software, purchasing a subscription for the Software or otherwise downloading, installing or using the Software, the Customer shall be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If the Customer is dealing with the Supplier as a consumer in the UK or EU, being an individual acting for purposes which are wholly or mainly outside that individual's trade, business or profession, certain terms of this Agreement may apply differently, as is expressly set out in this Agreement. Trial & Duration This Agreement shall commence on the date on which the Software is first downloaded by the Customer and shall initially be effective for a period of 30 days from the date on which the Software is first used by the Customer (the Trial Period), during which the Customer may use the Software in accordance with the terms of this Agreement free of charge. This Agreement shall expire at the end of the Trail Period unless the Customer purchases a subscription for the Software, in which case this Agreement will automatically renew for consecutive periods of 12 months commencing from the date on which the Customer purchases a subscription for the Software or the end of the Trial Period (whichever is later), or an anniversary of that date, (each an Annual Subscription Period). Either party may cancel this Agreement by giving 30 days written notice to the other during an Annual Subscription Period, but such cancellation will not become effective until the end of that Annual Subscription Period. Rights of Use In consideration of payment of the Fees, the Supplier grants to the Customer a non-exclusive right to use the Software in accordance with this Agreement for the purpose of encrypting data stored in on-premise server(s) and monitoring and controlling the Software user's access to that data, usage rights to that data and activity in relation to the use of that data. The Customer's rights to use the Software shall, subject to the terms of this Agreement, continue for the duration of this Agreement. Restrictions & Limitations Use of the Software is limited by the number of servers on which an instance of the Software may be installed and the number of user accounts which may have access to the Software on each server, as determined by the standard restrictions the Supplier imposes in the Trial Period and, following the Trial Period, the subscription type purchased by the Customer. The Customer must not exceed any such limits. For the Software to be transferred between servers it must be deactivated on the current server prior to being reactivated on another server. The Customer is entitled to download, install and use the Software in object code form only and shall have no right to have access to the Software in source code form. The Customer's must not (and must not permit any third party to): use the Software or any documentation provided by the Supplier other than as expressly permitted in this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Supplier, and the Customer acknowledges that additional fees may be payable for this; use the Software in any way which is in breach of any applicable law or regulation (including relevant export control laws and regulations) or any third party's right, or for any illegal or immoral purpose; except as expressly permitted in this Agreement or otherwise cannot be excluded by law or regulation, copy, adapt, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, modify, adapt or make error corrections to the Software in whole or in part or use the Software so as to subject any part of it to an open source licence; use the Software, any documentation or information provided by the Supplier or any know how obtained by the Customer from its use of the Software, to create any software or system which is substantially similar to the Software; or modify, remove, or obfuscate any copyright or other notice placed on or embedded in the Software. The Customer is not permitted to assign, sub-license, or provide or make the Software available to any person, or use the Software for any person, without the prior written consent of the Supplier. The Customer shall notify the Supplier as soon as it becomes aware of any unauthorised use of the Software by any person, including unauthorised use by the Customer. Warranties & Responsibilities The Software is made available to the Customer 'as is'. Neither the Supplier nor its Affiliates therefore represent, warrant or undertake that the Software will be error or defect free, available or will meet the Customer's particular requirements. The Customer acknowledges it has the benefit of the Trial Period to ensure the Software is fit for its own requirements. The Supplier may make self-service support available to the Customer to assist with issues that the Customer encounters when using the Software. The Customer acknowledges that no technology can guarantee the security of any data or that its encryption will never be broken. The Customer acknowledges that it is responsible for: backing-up data which is used in conjunction with the Software; and backing-up the master encryption key which encrypts the Customer's data using the Software (the Master Encryption Key) and all passwords used by the Customer to access the Software or to protect its data (Passwords), and maintaining the security and confidentiality of the same. THE CUSTOMER FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT WITHOUT THE MASTER ENCRYPTION KEY AND PASSWORDS THE CUSTOMER WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DECRYPT, ACCESS OR RECOVER ITS DATA IN ANY WAY AND UNAUTHORISED ACCESS TO THE MASTER ENCRYPTION KEY OR PASSWORDS COULD LEAD TO UNAUTHORISED ACCESS TO THE CUSTOMER'S DATA. NEITHER THE SUPPLIER NOR ITS AFFILIATES HOLD ANY COPY OF THE MASTER ENCRYPTION KEY OR PASSWORDS AND IF THE MASTER ENCRYPTION KEY OR PASSWORDS ARE LOST THE SUPPLIER AND ITS AFFILIATES CANNOT RECOVER THESE OR THE CUSTOMER'S DATA. NEITHER THE SUPPLIER NOR ITS AFFILIATES THEREFORE REPRESENT, WARRANT OR UNDERTAKE THAT USE OF THE SOFTWARE WILL NOT RESULT IN ANY LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF, OR UNAUTHORISED ACCESS TO, DATA. The Supplier is entitled to make changes to the Software from time to time, for example to make improvements or to address potential security vulnerabilities, and the Supplier may make an updated version available to the Customer. Where the Supplier has made an updated version of the Software available to the Customer, neither the Supplier nor its Affiliates shall have any liability in relation to any defects, errors, infringements, malicious code or security vulnerabilities in connection with a previous version. To the extent not prohibited by applicable law or regulation, all other conditions, warranties or other terms which might have effect between the Supplier or its Affiliates and the Customer or be implied or incorporated into this Agreement or any collateral contract, whether by statute, common law or otherwise, are hereby excluded, including the implied conditions, warranties or other terms as to satisfactory quality, fitness for purpose or the use of reasonable skill and care. If the Customer is dealing with the Supplier as a consumer in the UK or EU this exclusion does not affect the Customer's statutory rights as a consumer. Purchasing a Subscription & Payment The fees payable for each Annual Subscription Period (the Fees), will be determined by subscription type. If the Customer wishes to purchase a subscription for the Software at any time before, during or after the Trial Period, the Customer shall select its required subscription type, make payment of the initial Fees in respect of the initial Annual Subscription Period and provide its payment details through the Supplier's online store. The Customer shall provide the Supplier with notice of any changes to its payment details through the Supplier's online store. Following the Trial Period, unless payment of the Fees has been made in respect of the initial Annual Subscription Period when purchasing a subscription for the Software, the Software shall be blocked. Following the initial Annual Subscription Period: the Fees shall become due and payable on the start date of each Annual Subscription Period. The Supplier shall seek to take payment of the Fees on the same or similar date at the beginning of each Annual Subscription Period using the payment details provided by the Customer; and if payment of the Fees cannot be taken using the Customer's payment details the Customer shall receive a notification by email and further attempts to take payment may be made. If payment cannot be taken following any such further attempts then the Customer's use of the Software may be blocked until such time as its payment details are updated and payment of the Fees is made. The Customer shall not be entitled to any refund of the Fees in any circumstances save that, where the Customer is dealing with the Supplier as a consumer in the UK or EU, this does not affect the Customer's statutory rights as a consumer. The Supplier shall be entitled to charge interest on any overdue amount at the rate of 4% (four per cent) per annum above the base rate of the Bank of England from time to time, such interest to accrue on a daily basis from the due date until actual payment of the overdue amount. Interest must be paid together with the overdue amount. All sums payable under this Agreement are, unless expressly stated otherwise, quoted or stated exclusive of VAT or any relevant applicable taxes or charges including without limitation federal, state or local sales taxes which shall be charged at the prevailing rate and for which the Customer shall be responsible. The Customer shall make all payments under this Agreement without withholding or deduction of, or in respect of, any tax unless required by applicable law or regulation. If any such withholding or deduction is required, the Customer shall, when making the payment to which the withholding or deduction relates, pay to the Supplier such additional amount as will ensure that the Supplier receives the same total amount that it would have received if no such withholding or deduction had been required. Verification The Customer shall permit the Supplier or its appointee to inspect and have access to any premises and systems at or on which the Software is being kept, installed or used and all records relating to the same on reasonable notice to verify compliance with the terms of this Agreement. The Supplier may inspect and take copies of any applicable records. Intellectual Property Rights The Customer agrees and acknowledges that all rights, including all intellectual property rights in the Software, and including any updates, modifications and new versions of the same, and any documentation or information provided by the Supplier shall be owned and shall remain vested in the Supplier, its Affiliates or their licensors, and the Customer shall have no rights in or to the Software, documentation or information other than the right to use it in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Liability Nothing in this Agreement limits or excludes the Supplier's or its Affiliates' liability for death or personal injury caused by its negligence, any fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation or any other liability which cannot lawfully be so excluded or limited. Subject to clause 8.1, other than where the Customer is dealing with the Supplier as a consumer in the UK or EU, the Supplier and its Affiliates shall not be liable, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), statute, restitution or otherwise, for any: loss of profits; loss of business or revenue; loss of use or business interruption; loss of or damage to goodwill or reputation; loss or corruption of or unauthorised access to data; or indirect, consequential, special, punitive, exemplary or loss or damages. Subject to clause 8.1, where the Customer is dealing with the Supplier as a consumer in the UK or EU, the Supplier and its Affiliates shall not be liable, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), statute, strict liability restitution or otherwise, for any: business losses, including loss of profits, loss of business or revenue, loss of use or business interruption, or loss or corruption of or unauthorised access to business data; or loss suffered which is not foreseeable. Subject to clause 8.1, the Supplier's and its Affiliates' total aggregate liability arising in connection with the Software or this Agreement, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), statute, strict liability, restitution or otherwise, shall not exceed: in the Trial Period, $25 USD; and in each Annual Subscription Period, the Fees paid or payable in respect of that Annual Subscription Period. The Customer acknowledges that the Software is priced on the basis of the terms of this Agreement, and in particular the exclusions and limits in clause 4 and this clause 8, and the Customer agrees that these exclusions and limits are reasonable. Blocking Where the Software is blocked by the Supplier in accordance with this Agreement the Customer will only be able to access and decrypt their data and will not have any access to any other functionality of the Software and shall not be entitled to use the Software for any other purpose. Cancellation Without prejudice to any right or remedy of the Supplier, the Supplier may cancel this Agreement, in whole or in part, at any time on written notice to the Customer where the Customer commits any breach of this Agreement. In the event that the Supplier is entitled to cancel this Agreement in accordance with this clause 10, the Supplier may instead, without prejudice to any other right or remedy of the Supplier, elect to block the Software until the Supplier is satisfied that the cause of such issue has been remedied to its satisfaction. Upon cancellation of this Agreement for any reason: the Software will be blocked; and other than the right of the Customer to continue using the Software as blocked to access and decrypt their data, all rights granted to the Customer under this Agreement shall cease. Cancellation of this Agreement shall not affect any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities that have accrued up to the date of cancellation. General No failure or delay by a party to exercise any right or remedy provided under this Agreement or by law shall constitute a waiver of that or any other right or remedy, nor shall it prevent or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy. No single or partial exercise of such right or remedy shall prevent or restrict the further exercise of that or any other right or remedy. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between the parties relating to the matters referred to in this Agreement and supersedes any other agreement or understanding between the parties or any of them relating to the same. Each party acknowledges and agrees that it does not rely on, and shall have no remedy in respect of, any representation made (whether innocently or negligently) by any other party or any other person except as expressly set out in this Agreement in respect of which its sole remedy shall be for breach of contract. Nothing in this Agreement, however, shall operate or be construed to exclude or limit any liability for fraud including fraudulent misrepresentation. This clause does not apply if the Customer is dealing with the Supplier as a consumer in the UK or EU. The Supplier can make changes to this Agreement from time to time and will notify the Customer of any such changes. Any further use of the Software will be deemed to be acceptance of such changes. No other purported amendment or variation of this Agreement shall be effective unless it is in writing and signed by the parties. If any provision or part-provision of this Agreement is or becomes invalid, illegal or unenforceable, including where this is as a result of the Customer dealing with the Supplier as a consumer in the UK or EU, it shall be deemed deleted, but that shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the rest of this Agreement. If these circumstances should arise at any time, but the relevant provision would cease to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable if some part of it were modified, the provision shall apply with whatever modification is necessary to make the provision legal, valid and enforceable and to give effect, to the extent possible, to the commercial intention of the parties. A person who is not a party to this Agreement has no right under any applicable law or regulation or otherwise to enforce or to enjoy the benefit of any term of this Agreement and the parties shall not require the consent of any third party to vary or rescind this Agreement. Except for payment of any amounts, neither party will be liable for failure or delay in performing its obligations under this Agreement to the extent outside its reasonable control as long as it notifies the other party promptly of the cause and likely duration. Any notice to be given under this Agreement must be in writing and may be given by post, personal or email delivery provided that, in the case of email delivery, delivery is also made by post or personal delivery. Notices shall be sent to the party's registered office or its principal place of business or to such other place or email address as the relevant party shall have notified to the other from time to time. Any notice to be given shall be deemed to be effective when actually received (if sent by email), when left at the relevant address (if delivered personally) or 7 business days after posting by first class post addressed as required (if given by post). Law & Jurisdiction This Agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or its subject matter or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims) are governed by and shall be construed in accordance with English law. Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, including any question regarding its existence, validity or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration under the LCIA Rules, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this Agreement. The parties agree that: the number of arbitrators shall be one, and the arbitrator shall be experienced in technology disputes; each party shall bear its own costs relating to the arbitration; the seat, or legal place, of arbitration shall be London, England; and the language to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be English. This shall not prevent the Supplier from seeking any injunctive or equitable relief any court in the Supplier's or the Customer's local jurisdiction. If the Customer is dealing with the Supplier as a consumer in the UK or EU, either party shall be entitled to bring any proceedings in the Customer's local jurisdiction. Third Party Suppliers The Customer acknowledges that the Supplier may use third party suppliers to help deliver and administer the Software and the subscription process. These third party suppliers may have their own terms and conditions and privacy policies that apply when the Customer interacts with these third party suppliers and the Customer should ensure that it reviews and is agreeable to all such terms and conditions and privacy policies. The third party suppliers used by the Supplier include the following: wyDay LLC (wyDay), whose services are used to generate a license key for the Software and send it to the Customer. The Customer acknowledges that wyDay may use the Customer's data in accordance with wyDay's privacy policy at https:\/\/wyday.com\/privacy.php; and Bright Market LLC trading as FastSpring.com (FastSpring), who operates the Supplier's online store.

	{"title":"EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)", "text": "EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) What is the GDPR? The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a binding legislative act concerning the protection of personal data and individual rights. The GDPR replaces the Data Protection Directive 95\/46\/EC. It was designed to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe, to protect and empower all EU citizens data privacy and to reshape the way organizations approach data privacy. The GDPR requires companies to implement reasonable ways to protect their data, such as encryption, to protect it against data loss or exposure. Who is affected by GDPR? The GDPR applies to all organizations located within the EU, or outside of the EU, processing and holding the personal data of EU citizens, in order to: offer goods or services, or monitor their behavior within the EU. How can GhostVolt help towards compliance? The GDPR states:In order to maintain security and to prevent processing in infringement of this Regulation, the controller or processor should evaluate the risks inherent in the processing and implement measures to mitigate those risks, such as encryption. In order to prevent data breaches businesses must make sure that personal data is stored securely. GhostVolt uses the strongest encryption, 256-bit AES to encrypt rendering files useless when breached. What are the penalties for non-compliance? Organizations can be fined up to 4% of annual global turnover for breaching GDPR or €20 Million – whichever is greater. This is the maximum fine that can be imposed for the most serious infringements. It is important to note that these rules apply to both controllers and processors – meaning ‘clouds’ will not be exempt from GDPR enforcement. How does the GDPR handle personal data breaches? In the case of a personal data breach, the controller shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the supervisory authority. What are my main responsibilities under the GDPR? If your organization handles personal data, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) states that you are expected to put into place comprehensive but proportionate governance measures. These measures should minimize the risk of breaches and uphold the protection of personal data. The exact responsibilities that apply are different for every organization, depending on its size, industry and what kind of data is being stored. Ready to get started?

However, this right does not apply where it would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you have a legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged infringement. To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before the withdrawal. You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by written notice to us.

	{"title":"The cost of failing to encrypt your data", "text": "The cost of failing to encrypt your data Why smart people use encryption Security hacks, data breaches, ransomware—they’re the stuff of nightmares for individual computer users, business owners and organization leaders. Every day organizations big and small collect huge amounts of sensitive customer data ranging from personal details and financial records through to sensitive health care information, valuable intellectual property and vital business information. Some of this data collection is required to carry out everyday business transactions and some will be required for government agency reporting. Fig. 1: Annual number of data breaches and exposed records in the United States from 2005 to 2018 (in millions) But the problem for even the largest organizations is how to safely store the vast amounts of data and information in their possession. This data represents an enormously attractive target for hackers, identify thieves, terrorist organizations, and malicious lone wolves. The U.S Consumer Sentinel Network reports that fraud was responsible for losses of more than $900 million in 2017 alone. And it’s not just financial records that are targeted; your own personal information can be harvested and used to create fraudulent accounts. Security of your data is no longer only a concern for big business. Identity theft is on the increase too with an increase of 23% in credit card fraud alone and individuals are increasingly the target of email or phishing type scams. In fact, data security is becoming the number one challenge for anyone who uses the internet. The rapid development of new technologies and the sheer speed of evolution have meant that out-dated security measures just haven’t been able to keep up with the pace of change. I’ve got solid antivirus software and a firewall—isn’t that enough? The old laissez-faire attitude towards computer security is no longer adequate and neither are the traditional tools of firewalls, antivirus software, and easily remembered passwords. This is because hackers are constantly looking for new vulnerabilities to exploit. They can seek out and attack multiple weaknesses seemingly at random whilst you are left to guard the entire information fortress whilst constantly checking and updating every little loophole. That’s why antivirus software is always playing catch-up in response to zero-day or zero-hour attacks. Even the very best antivirus software is not infallible and frequently records false positives and overlooks malware. And then there’s the password game. Are you one of the 33% of people who use the same easy-to-guess password on every computer and app ? Or have you chosen, like 50% of people, from the same list of the top 25 passwords. Incidentally, it’s the same list of passwords that has been around since 1990. This just makes a hacker’s job so easy. But hey, you’re much smarter than that. You think you’re safe because you’ve got the best antivirus, solid passwords and an impenetrable firewall. Think again. Firewalls follow specific sets of rules. If a hacker generates a new virus that adheres to the firewall rules that virus will pass unchallenged and is free to commence its harmful activities inside your computer. Firewalls, for this same reason, also do nothing to protect your network from acceptable communications such as emails. Firewalls also offer no protection against internal attacks or employee sabotage—yes it happens. Firewalls, antivirus software, and tough passwords are definitely still essential tools but they are quite simply no longer adequate on their own. The Sceptre and Meltdown CPU vulnerability discovered earlier this year shows just how vulnerable your computer is. Both Sceptre and Meltdown are hardware issues that could allow attackers to bypass all your computer protection and steal passwords and other sensitive files and information. Nearly all computers are at risk from sceptre and meltdown even those running traditionally tough to crack Linux OS. Then, of course, if they physically steal your hard drives, your firewalls, antivirus, and passwords are basically ineffective. We’ve seen cases where ‘tough passwords’ were guessed fairly quickly, from knowledge dropped on social media – good encryption is a defense against this, since data is useless when it is encrypted. Yes, there are some serious threats out there and the consequences of not taking proper precautions could be devastating. What can go wrong if I don’t have adequate security? You don’t need to go far back in history to see what can go wrong when you don’t have adequate security protecting your sensitive information. Last year hackers gained access to Hudson’s Bay Brands point of sale software and stole 5 million credit card details. In 2017 hackers also appropriated millions of records from Yahoo. And earlier this year a data breach at LA County 211, a non-profit organization, exposed millions of records containing contact details, social security details, and even sensitive information about child abuse cases. But what is particularly interesting about the Hudson’s Bay hack is that the company was most likely rendered vulnerable due to employee slipups. And according to Gartner analysts “in the next few years, 80% of cloud breaches like these will be caused by customer misconfiguration, mismanaged credentials, or insider theft rather than by any inherent cloud provider flaw. In other words it’s that old adage about people being the weakest link. This is a huge concern for small businesses especially. It’s hard enough running your business, balancing the cash flow, complying with all the financial regulations and health and safety requirements etc. without having to lose sleep over security. However, the consequences of data theft are becoming increasingly severe and you can no longer afford to ignore this issue. As you can see from the Fig. 1, the percentage of survey participants who lost $5 million or more due to security breaches doubled between 2016 and 2017. But security negligence isn’t being punished only by hackers. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is taking an increasingly tough line against companies that don’t take security seriously enough. The FTC has prosecuted some 60 cases of data breaches involving negligence and collected more than $30 million in civil penalties for breaches of the Fair Credit Reporting Act FCRA. In 2015, the Toronto-based AshleyMadison.com dating site was charged with failing to protect 36 million users’ account and profile information. It cost Ashley $1.6 million to settle FTC and state actions. As Acting Chairman Ohlhausen stated in her written testimony to the House Committee, “Data breaches can harm a business’s financial interests and reputation as well as result in the loss of consumer confidence in the businesses to whom they entrust their data. In the case of small businesses, a data breach can be devastating.” But it’s so hard to keep up with all the requirements One of the consequences of the increased complexity of doing business today is that there is an enormous raft of legislation and regulation governing how organizations can collect and store personal data. Incorporating professional level encryption as an essential part of your security system package can make this burden a whole lot easier to deal with. Encryption forms a major component in data protection requirements for the following: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) HIPAA is all about protecting sensitive medical records. And at the same time as recognizing the greater ease and efficiency that electronic transfer of data provides it also offers increased security risks. In recognition of this greater risk the U.S government passed the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act. This HITECH act increases penalties for health organizations that violate HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules. PCI Data Security Standard The PCI Data Security Standard is all about protecting customers’ credit card details. If your organization stores financial details such as credit cards then your security needs to meet this standard. Encryption is an essential part of that. EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) This ruling applies to any business or organization storing information about European citizens. The GDPR gives control of personal information back to the consumer and places an enormous burden of responsibility for protecting that data on the business owner. The penalties for non-compliance are potentially devastating—up to $24 million. Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) This legislation governs those organizations that use personal data to screen creditworthiness, employment or tenancy suitability, insurance eligibility. Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) Protects shareholders and the general public from accounting errors and fraudulent practices in businesses and aims to improve the accuracy of corporate disclosures. Personal Information Protection & Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) --Canada This law governs the storage of personal information in private sector commercial organizations. Other national and international laws may include: Data Protection Act (DPA) of 1984 –Britain Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) Financial Instruments and Exchange Law of 2006 EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) What exactly is encryption? Encryption is quite simply one of the single most effective tools for safeguarding sensitive data in the modern era. Encryption involves scrambling data, files, and electronic information in a code form that can only be deciphered with the key that was used to encode it in the first place. You remember those codes you made at school where each letter in a word was replaced by a number? Thus A = 4, B = 5, C = 6 and so on. That’s a very simple form of encryption. One of the most common uses of encryption on the internet is for https at the start of so many website addresses. You’ll be familiar with the green or blue padlock up in the address bar. That indicates that your connection with that website is protected with encryption. How will encryption help my business? In a nutshell, encrypting all your data and sensitive information means that if hackers do gain access to your files, Google Drive or even physically steal your computers and hard drives they cannot actually read the encrypted data. You can think of encryption as your ultimate insurance policy and that if the worst comes to the worst your files will remain safe. Encryption is an essential part of every good security defense system. You still want to make sure all your firewalls, antivirus and software are up to date but encryption takes security to the next level.

Each user can have their own set of permissions including rights to read, edit, upload, download and even delete files, depending on the privileges granded to them by the Team Manager. Controls to manage your team can be found under the Users tab above the main toolbar. As you can see in the screenshot, one user has already been created – Joe, with a role of ‘Administrator’. Joe’s email address is listed, and as you can see, he’s not currently logged in, his account is not locked, and his password will expire (in a duration set by the Team Manager). Adding a new User To add a new user just click the Add User button in the main toolbar This will launch the New User window. This is where you will add your new user's details, assign a login password, setup their permissions and access rights and invite them to your GhostVolt Team either by email or any other method you wish, which we will look at later. Let's take a look at each step... User Details User Role GhostVolt allows you to create and customise the level of privileges your user has relating to every part of GhostVolt and the data you have stored within it. The User Role offers pre-set parameters to start with: Reader, Contributor, Editor, Administrator and Manager. The Manager role would have access to everything by default with Contributor having the least access. More on User Roles and customising your team is covered in User Access User Name Enter a descriptive name for your user. It may be their first name, full name or anything you choose, but it must be unique as this will avoid duplicate usernames and will help you identify them in your GhostVolt audit reports. The User name cannot be changed once it is saved. Email Address Your user will receive all GhostVolt notifications with this address. And it is not used as a unique identifier so it can be changed later if necessary. Login Password GhostVolt will automatically generate a very strong password for each user you create. This will give them means to access your GhostVolt Team. You can leave this as it is or change it if you wish, but it must be secure. Changing the Login Password If you choose to change the user Logon Password the password strength indicator will tell you how secure it is. This feature automatically checks a database of known common passwords and passwords that are a high security risk and displays an indication of how strong your entry is. There are five levels from weak to strong (green tick mark). A red cross would indicate a very poor password and will not let you proceed. User Access The User Access panel lets you customise the specific privileges you grant to your user within GhostVolt. Default User Access Once you set the User Role in the dropdown menu above, each option will set predefined access to items in the User Access panel. This is indicated by the checkboxes to the left of each item. Custom User Access You can customize the user's role by denying access to items simply by unckecking the box to the left. You can only deny access to certain items in the current User Role setting, you cannot grant access to items above the scope of that role, i.e. if you want the user to have access to more items simply choose a higher User Role in the dropdown menu above and continue to customize as you wish. Tip: You can quickly check or uncheck all available items in the current User Role setting by using the buttons in the top toolbar of the User Access panel. Folder Access Folder Access is where you grant the user access to folders in your GhostVolt repository. This panel provides a full view of all the current folders you have secured in GhostVolt. Grant or deny access to each of them simply by checking or unchecking the boxes to the left of each folder, or use the shortcut buttons in the top toolbar to check all or none with one click. Note: Your user can only interact with the folders under the conditions you set in the User Access panel.

As such, GhostVolt provides the system administrator with a multitude of insightful reports that enable you to monitor all aspects of user interaction with the GhostVolt platform. Within GhostVolt, you can see reports on Files and Folders, or on Team Members. Let’s start with reports on files and folders. File History report File history reports give you a quick overview of who and when the selected file was viewed, edited and shared. To begin let’s take a look at the history of a file. Navigate to the Home tab, then select the file you would like to view the history of then click the File history button: Before viewing the history of the selected file try opening and editing it first, this will ensure you have some history to view The report includes comprehensive filtering and searching mechanisms which give you greater control when looking for particular data points. You can sort by who made edits to a file, who viewed it, who shared it, and by name of the team member(s) that accessed the file. You can also use the ‘Search users’ feature as well as look for activity within a date range. These powerful features give the GhostVolt system administrator the ability to quickly find out information on GhostVolt system (and file) usage from any number of vantage points. File Audit report The file audit report contains all events relating to files that have taken place. The GhostVolt system administrator can see when files were added to the repository, when it was shared, opened for editing, viewed, moved, cloned and backed up plus many more data points. The audit reports includes the date of each events, the User that caused the event, the client computer, and some details about the operation, such as the path to the share, clone or backup. (Other events are logged as well). Navigate to the Home tab, then select the file you would like to view the Audit history of then click the File audit button: The file audit report Note that at the top of the screen the ability to adjust the reports output is available. The ‘Search’ box (above) is an especially powerful feature. It acts as a keyword search of the report, allowing the GhostVolt admin to search for the word ‘Opened’ and restrict the report output to just those events that qualify as ‘opening’ the file you previously selected. If the ‘Credit Card Statement’ file has been shared by hundreds of users, but only opened by a few, this powerful feature will give you a quick and easy way of seeing just those users that actually opened the file. You’ll also see the date, the user and details about the event you used in your keyword search (in this case ‘Opened’).But you could also do a keyword on a username. If hundreds of users have accessed the ‘Credit Card Statement’ file, but you are only interested in actions that the user ‘John’ performed, by doing a keyword search on the username ‘John’ will report back to you what user ‘John’ has been up to with that file. The Folder audit report The Folder audit report is very similar to the File audit report, but it works at the folder level, producing an audit history of all folder actions including creation, user access and user access removal, deletion, editing, encryption key changes and rotation. The audit reports includes the date of each event, the User that caused the event, the client computer, and some details about the operation. Navigate to the Home tab, then select the folder you would like to view the Audit history of then click the Folder audit button: The folder audit report Again, the GhostVolt system administrator has access to the same powerful search and filtering options that were available in the ‘File history’ and ‘File audit’ features. User reports While we’ve covered some of the capability to find GhostVolt user information, we discussed it when you were starting with file information. Sometimes, the GhostVolt system administrator may also want see reports about individual users themselves, without regard to any particular file they may or may not have accessed. The User audit report includes when the user logged on\/off, password changes, file usage, folder users, file additions\/removals plus many other data points. This information is easily generated by going to the Users tab and clicking to the User History button. While on the Users tab a list of all GhostVolt users will appear in the window below. Select a User and click on the History button to see a complete history of that User’s account interaction with the GhostVolt platform, including this actions performed by the system administrator setting up the users’ account. The user audit report Again, GhostVolt’s searching and filtering capabilities are outstanding and are easily accessed by using the search box at the top of the screen. For example, using the search box to search on the word ‘Password’ quickly brings up the password acceptance date, as well as the administrator that performed that event, the client computer and some key details. Another example would be to search on the work ‘lock’ and find all the dates a user’s account was locked and unlocked (Note that the left and right truncation of the keyword search ‘lock’ brings up both Locked and Unlocked events). To search for just ‘Unlocked’ events, included the ‘Unlock’ and you’ll see just those dates when the ‘Unlocked’ event took place. The keyword search is a very powerful feature in GhostVolt! One last note. To see your own history, go to the Home tab and select My history.", "img": "", "url": "http://ghostvolt.com/help/Reports.html"},

But, before we dig too deeply into the details, we’ll first review some of the key concepts that we use: Login Password When you start GhostVolt for the first time, you’ll be asked to create a login password. We do offer a password strength meter as a guide to help you in the right direction and also allow you to check if your password has been breached via ( HaveIBeenPwned). It’s extremely important to keep in mind that GhostVolt never stores a copy of your password nor do we even record or know your password at any time. Master Encryption Key Your Master Encryption Key is automatically generated when creating a GhostVolt server and is used to encrypt your Folder Encryption Keys (discussed below). Just like your Login password, Master Encryption Keys are never stored to disk, and we can’t recover them for you. However, you can choose to back-up your Master Encryption Key to an encrypted file: see here on how to do just that. User Master Key The User Master Key is a copy of the Master Encryption Key that is locked (via your Public Key) to a single GhostVolt user. Note: Only users with the appropriate privileges have a User Master Key. Folder Encryption Keys Folder Encryption Keys are automatically created when you create a new GhostVolt folder. These keys are used to encrypt all files stored within a particular folder and to restrict access. Every folder in GhostVolt has a unique Folder Encryption Key. Folder Encryption Keys are encrypted with the Master Encryption Key. Folder Share Keys Folder Share Keys give users of GhostVolt access to restricted folders and their contained files. The Folder Share Key is a copy of a folders Folder Encryption Key that is locked to a single GhostVolt user and folder. Only GhostVolt administrators can create Folder Share Keys and grant permission to folders. Folder Share Keys are encrypted via the users Public Key. Public\/Private Keys When creating a new User, a 4096-bit strong private\/public key-pair is automatically created. The Public and Private Key pair comprise of two uniquely related cryptographic keys (basically long random numbers). The Public Key is what its name suggests - Public. On the other hand, the Private Key must remain confidential to its respective owner. Because the key pair is mathematically related, whatever is encrypted with a Public Key may only be decrypted by its corresponding Private Key and vice versa. User Private Keys are encrypted with the users Login Password. We’ve covered a lot of technical details; because diagrams help, let’s take a look at how the security scheme fits together: Ok, let’s dig a little deeper into the details. Hold on tight. Granting users access to folders When granting a user access to a folder, GhostVolt uses your Login password to decrypt your Private Key which is then used to decrypt your User Master Key which is then used to decrypt the folders Folder Encryption Key. GhostVolt then encrypts a copy of the folders Folder Encryption Key using the users Public Key which creates a Folder Share Key for the user. How GhostVolt encrypts your files In its basic form, files are encrypted using the files parent Folder Encryption Key. As always, things are a little more complicated in practice, let’s take a look at the steps: Let’s say you are done with your yearly tax returns. First, you would log into GhostVolt in order to protect that tax return and the confidential information inside. Using GhostVolt, you’d naturally choose to add a file (your tax return being the file) to an already existing folder, which you cleverly named ‘Tax Returns’. Once you’ve selected your Tax Return file, GhostVolt then performs the following actions: Decrypts a copy of your Private Key using your login password as the encryption key. Decrypts your User Master Key with your decrypted Private Key. Using your decrypted User Master Key, decrypts your Folder Share Key that is associated to folder ‘Tax returns’. The file is now encrypted using the decrypted Folder Share Key as the encrypting key. Note: We use 256bit AES in GCM mode to secure your files. Your encrypted file is then sent to your file repository for storage. Clean-up. Any sensitive data in memory or on disk is cleaned. How users edit files Now that we’ve added a bunch of files to a folder, let’s take a look at how GhostVolt enables you and your users to view and edit your secured files. Log into GhostVolt and then choose a file, then select either View or Edit; once you’ve done this the process of decrypting and opening looks like this: A temporary copy of the selected file is retrieved from your GhostVolt repository and placed within a temporary location on your computer. Note: the file remains encrypted during transport. GhostVolt then decrypts your Private Key using your login password as the encryption key. Then we decrypt your User Master Key with your decrypted Private Key. Using your decrypted User Master Key, GhostVolt decrypts your Folder Share Key that is associated to the files parent folder. We now have the correct decryption key! The temporary file we copied in step one is now decrypted using the decrypted Folder Share Key. Clean-up. Any sensitive data in memory is cleaned, apart from your decrypted Folder Share Key as we need this later to re-encrypt the file.

	{"title":"EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)", "text": "EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) What is the GDPR? The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a binding legislative act concerning the protection of personal data and individual rights. The GDPR replaces the Data Protection Directive 95\/46\/EC. It was designed to harmonize data privacy laws across Europe, to protect and empower all EU citizens data privacy and to reshape the way organizations approach data privacy. The GDPR requires companies to implement reasonable ways to protect their data, such as encryption, to protect it against data loss or exposure. Who is affected by GDPR? The GDPR applies to all organizations located within the EU, or outside of the EU, processing and holding the personal data of EU citizens, in order to: offer goods or services, or monitor their behavior within the EU. How can GhostVolt help towards compliance? The GDPR states:In order to maintain security and to prevent processing in infringement of this Regulation, the controller or processor should evaluate the risks inherent in the processing and implement measures to mitigate those risks, such as encryption. In order to prevent data breaches businesses must make sure that personal data is stored securely. GhostVolt uses the strongest encryption, 256-bit AES to encrypt rendering files useless when breached. What are the penalties for non-compliance? Organizations can be fined up to 4% of annual global turnover for breaching GDPR or €20 Million – whichever is greater. This is the maximum fine that can be imposed for the most serious infringements. It is important to note that these rules apply to both controllers and processors – meaning ‘clouds’ will not be exempt from GDPR enforcement. How does the GDPR handle personal data breaches? In the case of a personal data breach, the controller shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the supervisory authority. What are my main responsibilities under the GDPR? If your organization handles personal data, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) states that you are expected to put into place comprehensive but proportionate governance measures. These measures should minimize the risk of breaches and uphold the protection of personal data. The exact responsibilities that apply are different for every organization, depending on its size, industry and what kind of data is being stored. Ready to get started?

	{"title":"HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996)", "text": "HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996)  HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability) What is HIPAA? The Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is a United States regulation designed to protect personal healthcare information (PHI). PHI includes conversations between a patient and their provider about a treatment, any medical information stored by the healthcare provider, and patient billing information. Who is affected by HIPAA? HIPAA applies to anyone who stores, transmits, or processes PHI. HIPAA requirements apply to both covered entities and business associates. Covered entities directly interact with the patient and include health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and healthcare providers. Business associates are any vendors or subcontractors that provide services to the covered entity that would give them access to PHI data or the devices that store it. How can GhostVolt help towards compliance? Encryption of data at rest and in transit is one of the core requirements of the HIPAA regulations. In fact, an organization is not even required to report a breach of PHI if all data included in the breach was encrypted. Ghostvolt provides a storage solution where data is encrypted at all times and access can be managed at a per-user level, putting an organization in line with HIPAA’s encryption requirements. What are the penalties of non-compliance? Penalties for non-compliance with HIPAA can be severe. HIPAA has four different tiers of breaches and fines for a violation of HIPAA can be $100-50,000 per violation with a yearly cap of $1.5 million per tier (or $6 million total). Non-compliance also can result in civil or criminal charges depending on the details of the infraction. How does HIPAA handle healthcare data breaches? The Office for Civil Rights (OCR) is the agency that enforces the HIPAA regulations. If a potential breach has been detected, the OCR will investigate and determine if and how an organization violated HIPAA requirements. After this is determined, the OCR can levy fines or press charges. What are my main responsibilities under HIPAA? HIPAA is composed of the Privacy Rule and the Security Rule, and an organization with access to PHI is required to be compliant with both. The Privacy Rule lays out national standards for the protection of PHI, while the Security Rule describes specific security controls that an organization is required to implement. Of these requirements, the need for encryption of PHI is of the highest importance, and a breach of encrypted data falls under Safe Harbor and is not necessary to report. Ready to get started?

	{"title":"Rethinking Security", "text": "2018 brought with it some unprecedented challenges in maintaining security against cyber threats; it also brought some of the most staggering and effective attacks to date, including the largest breach in history in which 500-million of Marriott’s customers' records were stolen. Cybercriminals, it seems, have stepped up their game-- we’ve seen increases in the frequency of ransomware, crypto-jacking and phishing attacks in businesses of nearly every size, location, and industry. Nearly 200 million ransomware attacks occurred last year alone with estimated damages over $8 billion.AI and machine learning are being leveraged by criminals, helping them to improve their attacks. As a result of these highly successful attacks, IT professionals are being charged with not just maintaining, but updating their layered security defenses to protect their organizations and users against the increasing likelihood of a breach. What changes, then, should organizations be making in order to enable their IT resources to adapt to these new and constantly evolving security challenges? During several public presentations recently, Martin Roesch, Vice President, and Chief Architect, Cisco Security Business Group, has asked his audience, “If you knew you were going to be compromised would you do security differently?” What then does this mean for organizations? What changes should be made to adapt to modern security challenges? Before an organization starts strategizing about tools or policies to implement, the first step is making a vital change in their overall security mentality from “assumption of protection” to “assumption of breach.” A recent article in SC Magazine stated, “Companies are still prioritizing protection over detection despite the fact that preventative capabilities alone are fundamentally incapable of stopping today’s cyber threats.” When transitioning to the assumption of breach model, an organization should start by looking at foundational security concepts in a different light. It’s also important to keep in mind that most breaches, in some way or another, are a result of some form of human error or manipulation. In other words, regardless of the security technologies you have in place, these are only as good as an organization’s security policies and their vigilant assurance that employees are following these policies. Employee training is the first step toward preventing security breaches. In fact, CompTIA reports that 9 out of 10 firms now employ security training to assess or improve knowledge among employees.", "img":"", "url": "https://blog.ghostvolt.com/blog/rethinking-security"},
	{"title":"Managing Accidental Data Leakages", "text": "With the advent of new data privacy regulations, data breaches are becoming more dangerous and expensive for organizations.  Previously, the main costs of a data breach lay in the loss of customers and minimal fines for negligence.  However, regulations like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) raise the bar, allowing fines up to 4% of an organization’s global revenue or 20 million Euros, whichever is larger.  In the United States, data protection and encryption requirements are mandated on a per-industry basis (PCI DSS, HIPAA, etc.) and now by state specific laws like the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) of 2018.  On average, a data breach cost organizations $3.62 million in 2017, and, with the new regulations, this will only grow. Understanding the data breach landscape is a critical part of protecting your organization.  While the majority of data breaches are caused by external threat actors, employees are at fault for a large percentage of them.  Identifying the risks and equipping your organization with the tools to mitigate them can do a lot to protect your organization from a costly incident. Many Breaches are Internal. In general, when people think of a data breach, they picture some hacker breaking through network defenses using malware or other means.  Very few consider the fact that employees are a major threat to organizational data security.  However, a survey by cybersecurity company Shred-it found that 47% of surveyed executives had experienced a corporate data breach caused by an employee.According to the 2017 Ponemon Cost of Data Breach Study, between a fifth and a third of all data breaches are caused by human error.  In healthcare, 53% of data breaches were caused by the actions of people within the organization.  Significantly, the HIPAA regulation within the United States does not require reporting of breaches of encrypted data, so all of these breaches could have been prevented by appropriate data encryption practices.Employees cause data breaches in a variety of different ways.  A common cause of data breaches in recent years has been the misconfiguration of cloud data storage services like Amazon Web Services (AWS).  In many cases, these services have two different levels of security: invitation-only and open to the world.  Employees who are frustrated by their inability to share documents with colleagues and not understanding these security settings will choose the “Public” option.  As a result, sensitive company data is visible to anyone who can guess the correct web address, causing leaks like when an unsecured cloud bucket leaked the Pentagon’s Internet surveillance archive..  Ideally, organizations would keep sensitive data off of cloud platforms; however, the advantages of cloud computing make this infeasible unless the organization offers another viable alternative.", "img":"", "url": "https://blog.ghostvolt.com/blog/managing-accidental-data-leakages"},

Every day organizations big and small collect huge amounts of sensitive customer data ranging from personal details and financial records through to sensitive health care information, valuable intellectual property and vital business information. Some of this data collection is required to carry out everyday business transactions and some will be required for government agency reporting. But the problem for even the largest organizations is how to safely store the vast amounts of data and information in their possession. This data represents an enormously attractive target for hackers, identify thieves, terrorist organizations, and malicious lone wolves. The U.S Consumer Sentinel Network reports that fraud was responsible for losses of more than $900 million in 2017 alone.

	{"title":"Blockchain fundamentals", "text": "Blockchain fundamentals ☰ For Individuals For Teams Store Downloads About Us Support Help Contact us 30 DAY FREE TRIAL Introduction to Blockchain: Fundamentals 1 2 3 At the most basic level, blockchain technology is composed of cryptographic algorithms. The creator of blockchain, Satoshi Nakamoto, developed a system in which the trust that we traditionally place in organizations to maintain trusted records (like banks) is transferred to the blockchain and the cryptographic algorithms that it uses. The Cryptography Behind Blockchain The goal of the blockchain is to create a distributed, decentralized, and trusted record of the history of the system. The most famous blockchain, Bitcoin, uses this record to store the history of transactions, so people can make and receive payments on the Bitcoin blockchain and trust that their money won’t be lost or stolen. In order to achieve this level of trust, the blockchain uses a couple of cryptographic algorithms as building blocks. Hash functions and public key cryptography are crucial to both the functionality and security of the blockchain ecosystem. Hash Functions A hash function is a mathematical function that can take any number as an input and produces an output in a fixed range of numbers. For example, 256-bit hash functions (which are commonly used in blockchain), produce outputs in the range 0-2256. In order to be considered secure, a hash function needs to be collision-resistant, this means that it’s extremely difficult (to the point of being nearly impossible) to find two inputs that create the same hash output. Accomplishing this requires a few different features: No weaknesses in the hash function A large number of possible outputs A one-way hash function (can’t derive the input from the output) Similar inputs produce very different outputs If a hash function meets these requirements, it can be used in blockchain. However, if any of these requirements are violated, then the security of the blockchain is at risk. Blockchain relies heavily on secure hash functions to ensure that transactions cannot be modified after being stored in the ledger. Public Key Cryptography The other cryptographic algorithm used in blockchain technology is public key cryptography. This type of cryptography is also widely used on the Internet as well since it has so many useful properties. With public key cryptography, you can: Encrypt a message so that only the intended recipient can read it Generate a digital signature proving that you sent a given message Use a digital signature to verify that a message was not modified in transit In public key cryptography, everyone has two different encryption keys: a private one and a public one. Your private key is a random number that you generate and keep secret. It is used for decrypting messages and generating digital signatures. Your public key is derived from your private key and, as the name suggests, is designed to be publicly distributed. It’s used for encrypting messages to you and generating digital signatures. Your address (where people sent transactions to) on the blockchain is typically derived from your public key. The security of public key cryptography is based on two things. The first is the secrecy of your private key. If someone can guess or steal your private key, they have complete control of your account on the blockchain. This allows them to perform transactions on your behalf and decrypt data meant for you. The most common way that blockchain is “hacked” is people failing to protect their private key. The other main assumption of public key cryptography is that the algorithms used are secure. Public key cryptography is based off of mathematical “hard” problems, where performing an operation is much easier than reversing it. For example, it’s relatively easy to multiply two numbers together but hard to factor the result. Similarly, it’s easy to perform exponentiation but hard to calculate logarithms. As a result, it’s possible to create schemes where computers are capable of performing the easy operation but not the hard one. The security of these “hard” problems are why you’ll often see articles about quantum computers breaking blockchain. Due to how quantum computers work, factoring and logarithms aren’t much harder than multiplication and exponentiation, so traditional public key cryptography no longer works. However, other problems exist that are still “hard” for quantum computers, so the threat of quantum computers to blockchain can be fixed with a simple upgrade. How Blockchains are Put Together As its name suggests, the blockchain is a collection of blocks that are chained together to create a continuous whole. In this section, we explore how this works. Blocks The purpose of the blockchain is to act as a distributed ledger that stores data in a secure fashion. The blocks are the place where this data is stored. The image above illustrates the basic structure of a block in a blockchain. We’ll talk about every part of this image throughout the series, but for now focus on the green sections. Each green piece represents a transaction within the block. While a transaction may represent a literal transaction (i.e. a transfer of value) on blockchains like Bitcoin, this is not the only option. As we’ll see later, smart contract platforms store other things (like computer code) as transactions as well. The security of the blocks in the digital ledger depends on the security of public key cryptography. Every transaction and block in the blockchain is digitally signed by its creator. This allows anyone with access to the blockchain to easy validate that every transaction is authenticated (i.e. sent by someone who owns the associated account) and has not been modified since creation. The integrity and authenticity of the blocks in the chain is also assured by the digital signature of the block creator. Chaining Each block is equivalent to a single page in a bank’s account ledger; it only represents a slice of the history of the network’s history. In order to combine these slides into a continuous whole, the blockchain makes use of hash functions. In the image above, you can see the hash functions linking each block together. Each block contains the hash of the previous block as part of its block header (the section not containing transaction data). The fact that every block is dependent on the previous one is significant because of the collision-resistance of hash functions. If someone wanted to forge block 51 in the image, they have two options: find another version of block 51 that has the same hash or forge every block after 52 as well. The first is supposed to be impossible (due to collision resistance) and the other should be difficult or impossible since the blockchain is designed to make forging even a single block difficult (more on this later). The security of the “chain” part of blockchain is based upon the collision resistance of the hash function that it uses. If someone can find a way to generate another version of block 51 that has the same hash, the immutability assumptions of blockchain break down and you can’t trust that any transaction will remain in the distributed ledger. What's Next... At this point, we’ve covered the fundamental cryptographic algorithms and data structures used in blockchain. The next two articles in this series are focused on the infrastructure behind the blockchain: the nodes and how they’re networked together.

	{"title":"Blockchain Nodes", "text": "Blockchain Nodes ☰ For Individuals For Teams Store Downloads About Us Support Help Contact us 30 DAY FREE TRIAL Introduction to Blockchain: Nodes 1 2 3 Traditional network services work on a client-server model. To access the shared resource, you (the client) connect to a server and request the official version of the file. This makes synchronization easy (since the server knows the most recent version) but is very centralized. This can be problematic because it requires trust in the server and the server is vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Blockchain is designed to be a completely decentralized system. Every node in the blockchain network has the ability to keep a copy of the distributed ledger, and the the official version of the shared ledger is updated via blockchain consensus mechanisms (covered in detail in the fourth section of this series). What Do Nodes Do? Nodes are a vital part of the blockchain ecosystem because they’re the ones that do everything. As a decentralized peer-to-peer system, everyone acts as a combined client and server. As a result, the duties of nodes are protocol-specific (rather than software-specific) and numerous. Protocol Not Software Like many other Internet applications, a blockchain is a protocol rather than a specific piece of software. Instead of mandating that everyone run the same executable to use a service (like Skype), the only requirement is that nodes communicate based upon the rules of the service. An example is HTTP, the protocol that defines how websites work. The structure and ordering of packets on the network is defined by the protocol, but no-one cares which software you’re running. As a result, there are a couple of different web servers (Apache, IIS, etc.) and many different web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.). These servers and browsers have agreed to follow the protocol, so they’re able to communicate with one another with no issues. Some blockchains are implemented using different software, while others have only one. When choosing blockchain software to run, it’s always a good idea to cross-compare the options. Common Node Tasks The purpose of the node is to implement and operate the blockchain. Each node has the ability to store a complete copy of the distributed ledger, and, if they do, to update it based upon the consensus of the network as a whole. As a result, nodes can participate in a variety of activities including transaction processing, block creation, and ledger management. Transaction Processing One of the most common tasks that nodes have is transaction processing. Anyone connected to the blockchain network through the node will send their transactions to the node to be added to the distributed ledger. The node is responsible for sending these transactions on to the rest of the network as well as forwarding on any transactions that it receives from other nodes to its peers in the network. Block Creation The blockchain is updated by adding new blocks to the existing chain. These blocks contain the data stored on the distributed ledger, and someone needs to collect this information into the block and distribute it to the rest of the network. Since there is no centralized server in blockchain, this means that the nodes are responsible for this as well. Using a blockchain consensus algorithm, a node is selected as the next block creator. They perform the tasks of creating the next block and starting its distribution (and are rewarded for their trouble). Ledger Management Finally, nodes are responsible for ensuring that the distributed ledger is properly stored and accessible. Every node has the potential to store a complete copy of the distributed ledger. Since not all users of the blockchain network are nodes (i.e. some people just use Bitcoin for performing transactions or investments), these nodes may occasionally be asked to send a copy of certain parts of the blockchain to a user in order to verify that a transaction made it onto the distributed ledger. Types of Blockchain Nodes The role distinctions in the blockchain network aren’t even as simple as node and not-node. In some cases, it’s possible to have different types of nodes. For example, Hyperledger permits a huge amount of role specialization, allowing nodes to only do the portion of the work that they are most suited to. One of the more common distinctions between nodes on the blockchain is full and lite nodes. As their name suggests, full nodes perform all of the job roles associated with being a node. These guys store a complete copy of the ledger and participate in consensus and block creation. A blockchain network needs a certain critical mass of full nodes in order to maintain its security and decentralization. Lite nodes are designed to make it easy for someone to perform and verify transactions without doing everything that a full node does. In the previous post in this series, we talked about how the block headers are “chained” together using hash values. Since these headers summarize all of the transactions contained in a block, they are all you need for verification of blockchain integrity. Lite nodes download the headers and only request the actual transaction data if they want to verify that a certain transaction was included in the block. This reduces the storage and communications requirements of lite nodes at the cost of a bit of decentralization. Security of Blockchain Nodes Nodes are the targets of most attacks on blockchain networks. While other attacks may have more name recognition (like 51% attacks), many attackers have found that it’s more profitable to target the individual users. Some threats at the node level are security misconfigurations, phishing, and malware. Security misconfiguration vulnerabilities occur when users modify the settings on their blockchain software without understanding the potential impacts. One example is a setting on a common Ethereum client that allowed external applications to communicate with wallet software via Remote Procedure Call (RPC). Attackers scanning for port 8545 were able to connect to the software and steal $20 million in Ether. Phishing attacks are also extremely common for blockchain users. The Electrum wallet is especially known for being a target of phishing attacks, with over $1 million in Bitcoin being stolen by just one attacker in a matter of hours. Finally, malware can be used on blockchain nodes for a variety of different purposes. Many of the attacks described in the remaining articles in this series can be performed using malware that targets the blockchain software on a node. Securing Your Node If you run a node on the blockchain, its security is completely under your control. Taking the appropriate steps to secure it like installing antivirus software, properly configuring it, and being aware of phishing scams can make a huge difference for your security and that of the blockchain network. The decentralization of a blockchain network makes it more difficult to defend against certain network-level attacks, but every secure node contributes to the health and security of the network.

	{"title":"Blockchain Network", "text": "Blockchain Network ☰ For Individuals For Teams Store Downloads About Us Support Help Contact us 30 DAY FREE TRIAL Introduction to Blockchain: Network 1 2 3 The blockchain is designed to store a trusted, shared distributed ledger. This ledger represents the history of the blockchain network, so the network level is an important one when discussing the blockchain ecosystem. In the previous post, we discussed the nodes and how they each maintain their own copy of the distributed ledger. Since the blockchain is designed to be trustless, no other node is going to implicitly trust any other node’s copy. They need a way to agree on the state of the ledger (consensus), and, for that, they need a way to communicate: the network. The Blockchain Peer-to-Peer Network Blockchains use a different network architecture than most of the web services that we’re used to. These services use a client-server architecture, where the server acts as a single source of ground truth, and the clients connect directly to it to upload or download application data. For example, when you use a webmail client like Gmail, your email doesn’t go directly from your computer to the recipient’s. Instead, you upload it to the Gmail servers and the recipient downloads it from a Gmail server to read. This system is simple and effective, yet it relies on the Gmail server to be a trusted middleman in the process. Blockchain isn’t big on trusted middlemen, so it uses a peer-to-peer network, where each node in the network communicates directly with other nodes. Most blockchain networks use a broadcast system where, if a node has five peers, every message that is received from one is sent to the other four. This way, messages percolate across the network over many paths, and no one has complete control over communications. The main implication of the peer-to-peer model for blockchain networking is that the underlying network needs to be able to support it. Since every peer needs to be capable of connecting to every other peer, you can’t effectively have a blockchain network distributed across a network with varying trust levels without compromising either blockchain or network security.Also, the “broadcast” communication style of the blockchain means that it requires a large amount of bandwidth to function properly. The inability to support this can have negative impacts on blockchain security and effectiveness. Attacking the Blockchain Network Many of the best-known attacks against blockchain systems are at the network level. Many people know that private key management is a problem and that smart contract vulnerabilities exist, but they’d be hard-pressed to even name the top ten most common smart contract vulnerabilities. On the other hand, Sybil attacks and 51% attacks are commonly mentioned in blockchain security-related posts. In this section, we’ll discuss three network-level attacks on the blockchain: Denial of Service (DoS), Eclipse, and Sybil attacks. A 51% attack can also be considered a network-level attack, but we’ll talk about it in the next post since it’s most closely related to consensus. Denial of Service Attacks Blockchains are distributed, decentralized networks, so it seems like Denial of Service (DoS) attacks should be impossible. DoS attacks target a single point of failure (like a webserver) or a bottleneck in a system and attempt to overwhelm it in order to degrade the operations of the system. Since blockchain (theoretically) has no single points of failure, DoS attacks shouldn’t be an issue. In practice, DoS attacks against the blockchain exist, but they attack temporary single points of failure or system bottlenecks. One such bottleneck is the transaction capacity of the blockchain. Most blockchains create blocks with a fixed maximum size at a fixed rate. An attacker can create a large number of spam transactions and transmit them to the network (similar to a DoS attack on a webserver). If the network can’t reliably identify them as spam transactions and ignore them, they’ll be added to the blockchain, taking up space that could have been used by legitimate transactions. Worse, blockchains are “forever”, so these spam transactions that make it onto the blockchain can take up storage space on nodes for the life of the blockchain. An example of a temporary single point of failure is the creator of a given block. Different blockchains have different methods of choosing this person, but in the end, one node puts a block together, signs it, and transmits it to the network. In some schemes (like Proof of Stake), if a block creator misses their “slot” for creating a block, they forfeit it. If you can force someone to forfeit a block (i.e. by a traditional DoS attack), that block is never created and the network loses some of its potential capacity. Eclipse\/Routing Attacks Eclipse and Routing attacks are two names for essentially the same attack. In an Eclipse attack, an attacker isolates a single node from the rest of the network by controlling all of its peer connections. In a Routing attack, the network is split up into two or more isolated groups. Both attacks can be used to facilitate a double-spend attack (by sending a different transaction to each isolated individual\/group) or a 51% attack (by filtering the victim’s view of the network state so that they mine a version of history that’s in the attacker’s favor). Eclipse and routing attacks can be performed by a variety of different means. External to the blockchain ecosystem, an attacker can control a node’s connection to the network using malware or any other traditional means of performing a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack. A study found that Bitcoin is especially vulnerable to BGP routing attacks, where the attacker convinces computers that the best route from A to B is through them. Internal to the blockchain ecosystem, an attacker can perform these attacks by controlling all of a node’s connections to their peers. Since blockchain networks are not fully connected (nodes only connect to a small number of other nodes), it’s possible that a node can only be connected to peers controlled by an attacker. It doesn’t matter how the attacker controls the node’s connection to the blockchain network as long as control is absolute. If this is true, the attacker may be able to selectively drop packets from other users or send mutually exclusive versions of transactions from their own addresses to drive the isolated groups’ versions of history apart. When the attack is completed, the longest block rule means that whichever version of the blockchain is shorter will be discarded (which is perfect for a double-spend attack). Sybil Attacks A Sybil attack is a simple network-level attack used to facilitate other attacks. In a Sybil attack, the attacker creates and maintains a large number of accounts on the blockchain network. This can be useful when performing an Eclipse\/Routing attack since, if the attacker controls most of the nodes accepting connections when a node is looking for one, there is a high probability that the node will only choose attacker-controlled connections. Up Next: Consensus Up to this point, we’ve talked about the fundamentals of the blockchain protocol and how it works and is attacked at a node and network level. In the next post, we’ll be discussing consensus: the way that these distributed and decentralized networks of nodes agree on their shared history.

	{"title":"Introduction to Blockchain: Consensus", "text": "Introduction to Blockchain: Consensus ☰ For Individuals For Teams Store Downloads About Us Support Help Contact us 30 DAY FREE TRIAL Introduction to Blockchain: Consensus 1 2 3 4 Blockchains are designed to be distributed, decentralized networks. Part of this includes removing the central authority used in many other systems. In a traditional financial system, banks centralize power by maintaining control of the ledger that states how much value is stored in each account. If a dispute arises over the ledger, the bank has the final authority to decide what the authoritative version is. Blockchain is designed to remove centralizing authorities like banks. Instead, the blockchain network maintains a shared, decentalized ledger with each node in the network maintaining a copy and updating it as each new block is created. The challenge with this is ensuring that all nodes make the same updates to their copies of the ledger with each block. Since the network does not have a consistent authority to create the official version of the ledger, it chooses a temporary authority to create and share each block. The mechanism for accomplishing this is called the blockchain consensus algorithm. Fundamentals of Consensus The job of the consensus algorithm is to ensure that control of the blockchain is decentralized so that no one user has the ability to control the network. The means by which this is accomplished is through making control of the blockchain network dependent on control of a scarce resource. No matter what consensus algorithm you choose, it boils down to the fact that control of a scarce resource equals power on the blockchain. In Proof of Work, this resource is computational power. In Proof of Stake, it’s the blockchain’s cryptocurrency. The logic behind using a scarce resource as a analog to power on the blcokchain is that it enables the use of economic incentives to protect the blockchain. The Law of Supply and Demand says that, if there is increased demand for a resource with a limited supply, then the price increases. When an attacker tries to gain control of a blockchain network (to perform a 51% attack or similar), they need to acquire more of the scarce resource to do so. As a result, they increase the demand for the resource, which increases the price to acquire it. Hopefully, the cost to acquire enough of the resource to perform a successful attack will be beyond the attacker’s resources. If not, we have successful 51% attacks against blockchains, which has certainly happened on smaller cryptocurrency networks. How Common Algorithms Implement Consensus When Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin, it was the only blockchain in existence. The Bitcoin whitepaper described the Proof of Work consensus algorithm used on the Bitcoin network. Since then, many other consensus algorithms have been developed for different blockchain implementations. Of these, Proof of Stake also receive a lot of attention, partly due to its presence on the Ethereum roadmap. Proof of Work Proof of Work is the original consensus algorithm, and, as its name suggests, it involves making people do work. In Proof of Work, miners are the ones attempting to create a new block. The way that the block creator is selected is by implementing a race where the winner creates the block (and earns the associated rewards). This race involves creating a valid block, where the condition for validity is that the header of the block hashes to a value less than a given threshold. Due to the properties of hash functions, the best way of accomplishing this is by random guessing. As a result, the miners in the network try random hashes until one stumbles across a nonce that creates the desired hash output. The first miner to find a valid block then transmits it to the rest of the network to build the next block on top of. The main issue with Proof of Work is that the criteria for block creation is the ability to create a valid block. There is nothing to say that two different miners can’t find different versions of the block around the same time. If this occurs, a divergent blockchain may be created with different parts of the network building on top of different blocks. Blockchain resolves this using the longest block rule, which says that, in a conflict between two versions of the blockchain, the longer one should be accepted. Proof of Work also tries to minimize the probability of divergent blockchains using the concept of difficulty. The threshold value that a valid block header’s hash must be less than can be updated in a distributed fashion. The difficulty is updated at regular intervals so that the creation of blocks (with the current computational power of the blockchain network) occurs at the desired block rate. Proof of Stake Proof of Stake takes a different approach to securing the blockchain using a scarce resource. Instead of using scarce computational power (like Proof of Work), Proof of Stake uses the blockchain’s scarce cryptocurrency. Proof of Stake works a lot like investing in a company. By giving some of your money to a company, you have the right to receive investor dividends. In Proof of Stake, you promise not to spend a portion of your cryptocurrency (or stake it) in exchange for the chance to be a block creator (and earn the associated rewards). The mechanics of how block creators are selected based on stakes varies based upon the implementation. In some implementations, the probability of being selected is directly proportional to the size of the user’s stake. In others, the concept of coin age is introduced, where stakers who have not been selected to create a block in some time have an increased probability of being selected. Regardless, control of more staked cryptocurrency in Proof of Stake equates to increased control over the blockchain. One issue with Proof of Stake is the potential for a user to create multiple versions of the same block. Since the only criteria for a block to be valid is a signature by the chosen block creator, it’s possible for a user to sign multiple versions of the same block. In fact, this is one place where blockchain incentives break down since, if presented with two versions of the blockchain to build upon, it’s in the block creator’s best interest to build on both to ensure that whichever version eventually wins out includes the block that pays them their block reward. Attacking Consensus Consensus mechanisms are the key to controlling the blockchain. As a result, many attacks on the blockchain are based upon gaining this control. If successful, an attacker can perform a double-spend attack, which allows them to complete one transaction and then remove it from the ledger at a later date. Some attacks against consensus have been known from the beginning (like the 51% attack), while others (like long-range attacks) were developed later. 51% Attacks 51% attacks are probably the simplest way to attack a Proof of Work blockchain and occur when the economic incentives of the blockchain don’t work. Under the longest block rule, every benign node is obligated to choose the longer option when presented with two contradictory versions of the blockchain. If an attacker has the ability to create the longer version at will, then they control the blockchain. In Proof of Work, this is accomplished by controlling over half of the computational power of the blockchain network. Since creation of valid blocks requires randomly searching the space of potential options, whomever can search the space more quickly can create blocks faster.Similar attacks are possible on Proof of Stake, but it requires a greater level of control over the scarce resource. In Proof of Work, you need 50% of the computational power to have a 100% chance of finding the next block. In Proof of Stake, you need 100% of the staked cryptocurrency to have a 100% chance of forging the next block. Since this is unlikely, an attacker trying to control a Proof of Stake blockchain needs to accept the possibility of failure. Long-Range Attacks Long-range attacks can be used on Proof of Stake blockchains to give an attacker the controlling portion of the staked cryptocurrency necessary to attack the consensus algorithm. In this attack, the attacker creates a divergent version of the blockchain all the way back to the genesis block (this assumes that they have a stake in the genesis block). On their divergent blockchain, the attacker creates a new block whenever they are selected as the block creator. Since they are the only ones creating blocks, they’re the only ones receiving block rewards. Over time, the attacker has the controlling stake in the divergent blockchain.However, the divergent blockchain will only be accepted if it is longer than the “true” version of the blockchain. Since the attacker can only create blocks on their version when it’s their turn, their divergent blockchain will fall behind the main chain whenever a benign user is selected to create a block. While this happens less frequently as they control more of the stake, the attacker’s chain is significantly behind in the beginning. In order to catch up, the attacker deliberately passes up their opportunities to create blocks on the main chain. Between these missed blocks and ones missed by natural causes (or due to a Denial of Service attack on the chosen block creator), the attacker’s chain has the opportunity to slowly catch up to the main chain. When this occurs, the attacker can publish their malicious divergent blockchain and gain control of the blockchain. Up Next: Smart Contracts At this point, we’ve examined the security implications of each level of the original blockchain. However, blockchain technology has advanced since the publication of the Bitcoin whitepaper The remaining two articles in this series are devoted to technology built on top of the original blockchain: smart contracts and blockchain extensions.

	{"title":"PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act)", "text": "PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) ☰ For Individuals For Teams Store Downloads About Us Support Help Contact us 30 DAY FREE TRIAL PIPEDA (Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) Canadian Data Privacy Laws: What you need to know We’ve heard all about GDPR -- it’s hard to miss it, right? But did you know that Canada has actually been leading the charge in data privacy, even ahead of the EU? Until very recently, it hadn’t even been a blip on my radar despite the potential-or even likely-implications this has on many American enterprises that do business in Canada; it also highlights how woefully behind the U.S. is in enacting federal laws to protect its citizens’ data. By now, nearly everyone is probably familiar with the Equifax data breach that occurred in 2017 and affected the data of nearly 150 million people; in early April, roughly eighteen months after the breach was first reported (6 weeks after Equifax discovered it), the Canadian Privacy Commissioner’s office released the results of its investigation into the breach. Long story short, there were numerous violations of Canadian laws; the Government Accountability Office released two reports, one on the response to the Equifax breach (which included long-term recommendations to restore the trust in the credit-reporting bureau) and another on the need for better oversight of consumer reporting agencies. In the US, though, the response by the federal government was lackluster at best and the majority of actions against Equifax have come at a local level with eight states issuing consent orders requiring the credit bureau to conduct more risk assessments and internal audit programs for consumers’ personal data. To date, the US has yet to take any strong action against Equifax; neither the FTC nor the CFPB (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) have taken any steps to reprimand the company or even force it to increase its security moving forward. The current federal government has shown repeatedly that it cares little about this incident, in particular, and data security in general. Background of PIPEDA Unbeknownst to me, Canada has been at the forefront of data protection as early as 2000 and was based on the 10 principles outlined in the Model Care for the Protection of Personal Information all the way back in 1996 and included accountability, consent and the limiting of data collection, among others. The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) include ten criteria, referred to as the fair information principles, and represent the foundation of PIPEDA. Today, these principles can also be found in the GDPR legislation. Speaking of GDPR, the Canadian government was one of the first to acknowledge the need to update its legislation to safeguard the continuity of data transfers between the Great White North and the EU block. An amendment to PIPEDA, the Data Privacy Act, actually predated the final text of GDPR by six months, being adopted in June of 2015, though it did not go into effect until November of 2018. The Data Privacy Act requires organizations subject to PIPEDA to report to the OPC breaches of security safeguards involving personal information “that pose a real risk of significant harm” to individuals; notify affected individuals of the breach; and keep records of every breach of security safeguards, regardless of whether or not there is a real risk of significant harm. Who does PIPEDA apply to? PIPEDA applies to the collection, use or disclosure of personal information in the course of a commercial activity. Also under this umbrella are federally-regulated businesses such as airlines, banks and telecom companies. In essence, this means that political parties and associations as well as hospitals, educational institutions and not-for-profit organizations are outside of the jurisdiction, providing they don’t engage in any commercial activities. Although collecting memberships fees and donations, compiling lists of members or donors for communication purposes as well as fundraising are not considered commercial activities, the selling, leasing or bartering of this information is considered a commercial activity and would therefore be subject to PIPEDA regulations. Additionally, federal government departments and agencies do not fall under PIPEDA. Although not explicitly stated, the Federal Court of Canada has ruled that PIPEDA does apply to businesses found in other jurisdictions if there is a “substantial connection” between an organization’s activities and Canada. In other words, organizations in the US as well as other countries globally that collect, use, or disclose the personal information of Canadians in the course of their commercial activities are regulated under this legislation. What is “personal information” under PIPEDA? PIPEDA’s definition of “personal information” is extremely broad. “Personal information” is defined as any “information about an identifiable individual.” This definition of “personal information” encompasses any factual or subjective information, recorded or not, about an individual, including, but not limited to, name, age, ethnic origin, religion, Social Insurance Number, email address, health information, financial information, biometric information, employee files, credit reports, and education history. Mandatory Notification Requirements Individuals must be notified of any breach of the security of safeguards involving their personal information if there is a reasonable belief that the breach creates a “real risk of significant harm.” At the same time, the exposed organization must also report to the Privacy Commissioner of Canada. In order to determine if a breach actually poses a real risk of significant harm to individuals, organizations are granted the chance to undertake a risk-harm analysis prior to beginning the required notifications; if there no risk of significant harm, the organization is not required to issue any notifications. Notifications must occur as soon as possible once the breach has been identified. The Privacy Commissioner must be notified via a secure means; individuals must be notified in person, by telephone, mail, email, or any other form of communication that a reasonable person would consider appropriate PIPEDA will also require organizations to notify additional government institutions if the organization believes that there is an opportunity to reduce or mitigate the risk of harm to the affected individuals by issuing a notification. Most notably, PIPEDA requires organizations to keep and maintain a record of every breach of security safeguards for two years even if the breach is not required to be reported. Although the definition of record in this case is subject to interpretation, it must contain any information that enables the Privacy Commissioner to verify compliance with PIPEDA. On request, an organization must be prepared to provide the Privacy Commissioner with access to, or a copy of, any record. While the extent of Canada’s privacy laws by far outpaces any type of federal legislation currently on the books in the US, the Privacy Commissioner, Daniel Therrien, said the updates to PIPEDA were a “step in the right direction,” he also voiced concerns about the law including the lack of insight into an organization’s data safeguards in the required reporting as well as the lack of significant financial sanctions for inadequate data security safeguards citing a missed opportunity to incentivize organizations to prevent breaches (fines are currently capped at $100,000 CAD).

	{"title":"What is CCPA & Why Does it Matter?", "text": "What is CCPA & Why Does it Matter? ☰ For Individuals For Teams Store Downloads About Us Support Help Contact us 30 DAY FREE TRIAL The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) The California Consumer Privacy Act In order to understand The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), you first need to understand the proverbial straw that broke the camel’s back. While GDPR sparked many U.S. states to begin proposing their own data protection laws, it wasn’t until the Cambridge Analytica\/Facebook scandal broke that the (U.S.) public outcry over data privacy reached critical mass. Cambridge Analytica, a political analysis firm that claims to build psychological profiles of voters, is accused of buying nearly 90 million Americans' data that was collected without their consent from a researcher who told Facebook he was collecting it strictly for academic purposes. The outrage, though, originates from the fact that the researcher, after collecting this ungodly amount of personal data, sold it to Cambridge Analytica, which is against Facebook’s rules. Cambridge Analytica issued a number of press releases in the days following the explosive media reports, vehemently denying that they acted improperly with the data (i.e. they used it to help their political clientele further their campaigns--shocker). Following this scandal, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched an investigation that focused largely on the controls an organization must have on how its data is shared with and used by third parties -- in other words, the probable infancy of GDPR in the States. Taking a cue from the FTC, in June of 2018, California, ever the echelon of change among states unanimously passed The California Consumer Privacy Act. CCPA applies to businesses that fall under any one of the below categories: Have annual revenue in excess of $25 million Buy, receive, sell, or share personal information on 50,000 or more CA households or devices Derive more than half of their annual revenue from selling consumer personal information Although the CCPA does not go into effect until January 1, 2020, there are critical considerations to start thinking about now For example, one of the most important compliance factors companies need to be aware of is that they must be able to provide data usage records for the previous 12 months--beginning on January 1, 2020; meaning if an organization didn’t start tracking personal data usage at the beginning of this year, they could potentially be facing hefty fines or even lawsuits. To provide context, on the first day that GDPR took effect, Facebook and Google alone were hit with nearly $9 billion in lawsuits. I would expect the same aggressive litigation to start on the first day of CCPA. CCPA has six main components and covers both traditional PII (personal identification information) --name, social security number, email address, etc.--as well as non-traditional items such as biometric data, IP address, internet browsing or search history, geolocation data, audio, electronic, visual, olfactory, or similar information. If a business hasn’t already started prepping, quite honestly, they’ll be working against the proverbial clock. Any company that does business with California residents should be ready to respond to the look back requirement and the new rights given to consumers and therefore should understand where all the personal information about their customers lives and where and how it flows with their organization. With GhostVolt Business, your organization can view the complete history of all files (including deleted ones) and the audit history of files, folders, and users. GhostVolt also includes a reporting module, allowing you to generate crisp reports on activity with ease. Likewise, those businesses that need to comply with CCPA should also consider the following to updates to their compliance policies: Update website privacy policy to meet new data disclosure, consent, and opt-out requirements Ensure employee privacy policy notice complies with CCPA requirements Execute master service agreements with restrictions for data use by required service providers Implement incident response plans that enable the organization to respond effectively in the event of a data breach Given the active legislative changes at both the state and federal level, data privacy risks should be one of the top risks managed by enterprises as part of a thorough risk management framework. Data encryption is an important component of that risk management framework. If data is stolen while protected by a secure encryption algorithm, it’s impossible for an attacker to read it without access to the encryption key. As with all new legislation, the CCPA is a work in progress, and without a doubt it will be amended and revised going forward. Of course the federal law and additional state regulations are sure to follow. One very clear trend is evident: We’re now living in an era of data and web- based regulations and companies need to not just understand the regulatory environment, they now have to deploy solutions that will protect them from liabilities that working with consumer data entails. As the legal circumstances evolve in the coming months and years, the foundational work of building an information and data access control program will prepare your business to meet these emergent challenges. How can GhostVolt help? GhostVolt, a powerful security application for teams, encrypts data using the AES-256 encryption algorithm both at rest and in transit. AES-256 is the algorithm approved by the US government for encryption of classified data and is considered the standard for data encryption.

	{"title":"Introduction to Blockchain: Smart Contracts", "text": "Introduction to Blockchain: Smart Contracts ☰ For Individuals For Teams Store Downloads About Us Support Help Contact us 30 DAY FREE TRIAL Introduction to Blockchain: Smart Contracts 1 2 3 4 5 Blockchain Smart Contracts In the beginning, blockchain was designed to replace the financial system. The distributed, decentralized ledger maintained by the blockchain network is used to record the transactions performed using the blockchain financial system. As a result, cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin can implement complete, trustworthy financial systems without a central authority (like a bank).The distributed, decentralized ledger offered by blockchain technology is useful for more than just recording financial transactions. Smart contract platforms are designed to run a Turing-complete computer on top of the blockchain, allowing smart contracts to fulfill a variety of different functions. Introduction to Smart Contracts Smart contract platforms use the underlying blockchain technology but modifies it to use it to run arbitrary, third-party programs on top of it. Instead of transactions including actual financial transactions, they include computer instructions designed to be run by the blockchain’s virtual machine. Since the blockchain network is distributed and decentralized, there is no central computing platform that runs the code and updates the state of the smart contract platform with the result. Instead, each node in the network runs its own copy of the virtual machine and executes the code contained in the transactions in each block of the blockchain. Since code is designed to be deterministic and is organized into a block before execution, the network is able to remain synchronized at all times. Smart Contract Security The blockchain landscape is fragmented, and so is the landscape of smart contract blockchains. The basic blockchain solution has been adopted and adapted in many different ways, making it difficult to create a definitive list of smart contract vulnerabilities. Since Ethereum is the best-established smart contract platform, many lists of smart contract vulnerabilities focus on this. The Decentralized Application Security Project has compiled a list of the most common smart contract vulnerabilities on the Ethereum platform, which are explored here. Reentrancy Reentrancy is probably the most famous of the Ethereum smart contract vulnerabilities. Exploitation of this vulnerability in The DAO smart contract caused Ethereum to break its blockchain’s immutability and rewrite history to erase the attack. This controversial decision caused a split in the Ethereum network that created the Ethereum Classic cryptocurrency. Reentrancy is possible in Ethereum due to the existence of payable fallback functions. These functions are designed to run when value is sent to the smart contract, allowing it to update its internal ledger, perform some functions, etc. The issue with this setup is when a vulnerable smart contract function that the attacker can control (like a refund function) can be forced to call a malicious fallback function. Vulnerable functions use the following control flow: Check transaction validity Perform send Update internal ledger With this control flow, the malicious fallback function is run as a part of step 2, before the vulnerable function updates state. If it calls the vulnerable function again, the transaction will still be considered valid (since the state isn’t updated) and run again, allowing the attacker to withdraw twice as much value as approved. Access Control Some smart contracts are designed to have protected functionality. For example, you can implement wallets as smart contracts where anyone can send value to it but only the owner can extract value from it. Some of these smart contracts have a function for claiming ownership, where the owner of the smart contract (and the one permitted to call protected functionality) is set to the person who called the function. The issue with these functions is that sometimes people forget to set the function to check that this is the first time the function is called. If they fail to do so, the owner is whoever called the function last, not first. Arithmetic Arithmetic vulnerabilities like integer overflows and underflows are nothing new with blockchain. They’ve existed in software programming for some time and have only become less common due to the existence of programming languages that make them impossible (like Python). Unfortunately, some smart contract programming languages are now vulnerable.Arithmetic vulnerabilities occur when certain variable types are misused. Integer overflow vulnerabilities occur when a programmer uses too small of a variable to store a value. Underflow vulnerabilities occur during switches between signed variables (where a one in the most significant bit means negative) and unsigned variables (where a one in the most significant bit means a large, positive number). Performing subtraction with unsigned values always results in a positive number, which can be problematic since these tests are often performed to check the validity of a transaction. Unchecked Return Values An Ethereum-specific feature that can trip up novice smart contract developers is the fact that it does not have a consistent means of indicating when low-level functions fail. Some low-level functions throw an error if they fail, which terminates execution. Other ones return a value of false and allow the code to continue running. If an programmer assumes the first case for a certain function and doesn’t check function return codes, it’s possible to put their code in an unexpected (and potentially invalid) state. Denial of Service Just like the underlying blockchain can be vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks, smart contracts can also be rendered non-operational by a malicious (or benign) user. Denial of Service attacks on smart can be accomplished in a variety of different ways.One way to attack a smart contract is to exploit an access control vulnerability. Well-designed smart contracts include a self-destruct function that would render the contract unusable if an attacker gains access to and executes this function. Bad Randomness Smart contracts often need access to random numbers. In fact, many smart contract are designed to implement gambling games, so they need the ability to generate secret random numbers. There are several means of generating random numbers in code, and many of these are considered “best practice” in traditional applications. However, the blockchain environment is different, making the following means of generating randomness insecure: 'Secret' Values: Like seeding a pseudo-random number generator, some smart contracts use 'secret' values to create randomness. However, everything is public on the blockchain, so an attacker can observe this value and predict the 'random' values 'Secret Code': Using a proprietary algorithm for generating random numbers is not a great idea but it often works. However, it fails on blockchain for the same reason as the 'secret' values. External Input: Using external sources of entropy is a common method of generating randomness in traditional applications. However, any source of entropy visible to one smart contract is visible to any other, making it easy to observe and exploit. In the end, the best way to generate random numbers on the blockchain is to use an external source of randomness that the smart contract can query. However, this has to be done carefully to ensure that malicious smart contracts can’t see it as well. Race Conditions In traditional programming, race conditions are when two or more threads are competing for resources, and the behavior of the program is dependent on which one gets there first. In the blockchain, multiple transactions may be competing for recognition by a smart contract and the result depends on whichever transaction is processed first. For example, a contest may exist where the first person to solve a puzzle wins some prize. A benign user solves the puzzle and submits their solution to the smart contract as a transaction. However, transactions are not instantly processed, are publicly visible before processing, and are organized for processing based upon transaction fees. If an attacker sees the user’s solution, copies it, and submits a transaction with a higher transaction fee, the attacker is likely to win the contest without doing any work to solve the puzzle. Timestamp Dependence Another way that these contests can go wrong is if they depend on the current time on the blockchain as a condition for the contest. For example, a smart contract may run a contest where the first submission after midnight on a certain day is the winner. On the blockchain, the current time is the time of the most recent block, and this is set by the block creator. Further, there is some wiggle room (often up to two hours) in timestamps to deal with propagation delay, non-synchronized clocks, etc. (in fact block timestamps don’t even have to be in order). An attacker who manages to create a valid block with a timestamp of midnight before midnight but within the acceptable window can win this contest before anyone else tries to play. Short Addresses Short address vulnerabilities in Ethereum are caused by variable sizes, how arguments to a function are stored in memory, and how Ethereum pads arguments that are too short.In this attack, the attacker calls a vulnerable smart contract function designed to send value to a certain address (like the refund function from the reentrancy vulnerability). In this call, the attacker deliberately sends a destination address that is one byte too short and a value of the correct size. The function checks the value and, if the transaction is valid, calls a function to transfer the value. This transfer function specifies the size of its arguments and expects a destination address of a given size. As a result, it fills the address variable with the provided address and the first byte of the provided value. Now, the value is too small, so Ethereum zero-pads it on the right, effectively multiplying it by 256. As a result, if the new destination address is controlled by the attacker (which they can assure before they perform the attack), they receive 256 times more value than the vulnerable function authorized. Unknown Unknowns The final smart contract vulnerability included in the DASP list was unknown unknowns. Blockchains in general, and smart contract platforms in particular, are a relatively new technologies. It is extremely likely that new vulnerabilities will be discovered and take the top slots for smart contract vulnerabilities in future years. The Final Chapter: Blockchain Extensions The articles to date have covered the topics used by most blockchain and smart contract platforms. However, some extensions and second-level protocols have been developed to fix the deficiencies of the blockchain. The final article in this series will discuss some of the security considerations for these technologies. Guest author Howard Poston is a cybersecurity and blockchain security consultant and trainer.

	{"title":"Blockchain tutorial : Part 6 - Extensions", "text": "Blockchain tutorial : Part 6 - Extensions ☰ For Individuals For Teams Store Downloads About Us Support Help Contact us 30 DAY FREE TRIAL Introduction to Blockchain: Extensions 1 2 3 4 5 6 Blockchain Extensions Blockchain technology provides users with a number of advantages not present in traditional systems. Blockchains are the first fully distributed and decentralized system that is capable of maintaining a shared, trusted ledger. This allows a network to keep a record of its history and be confident that a malicious user or users is not capable of modifying this history to their own benefit. However, blockchain technology isn’t perfect. Bitcoin was originally designed to replace traditional payment systems (like credit cards); however, by itself doesn’t have the ability to do so. Blockchain technology has limitations, and blockchain extensions have been developed to help mitigate or eliminate these. Limitations of Blockchain Blockchains has a very specific structure. Due to the need for the network to remain synchronized and for the network to validate all transactions, transactions cannot be continuously added to the distributed ledger. Instead, transactions are organized into blocks, which are added to the distributed ledger at regular intervals. This design limits the speed and capacity of the blockchain solution. The speed at which transactions are added to the distributed ledger is severely limited on the blockchain. Blockchains typically have a target block rate, that is enforced at some level by their consensus algorithm. For example, Bitcoin has a block rate of 10 minutes, meaning, with the three block rule, you may have to wait half an hour before a transaction is considered trustworthy. This compares unfavorably with credit cards, where a “slow” transactions is done in a minute. Blockchains also have an issue with a maximum capacity. In addition to the set block size, many blockchains have a set maximum block size designed to protect against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. With fixed-size blocks created at fixed intervals, the blockchain can only process so many transactions in a time period, and this capacity is often far below that of the payment card system. Blockchain Extensions Some distributed ledger technologies have abandoned the blockchain data structure in order to address these problems. For example, IOTA uses a directed acyclic graph (DAG) as its underlying data structure, which greatly increases its transaction speed and capacity. Some blockchains make small protocol tweaks (like increasing the block rate) to improve transaction speed and capacity. And some blockchains have begun leveraging blockchain extensions to help address these issues while maintaining the original design of the blockchain. Sidechains Sidechains are primarily designed to increase the capacity of the blockchain by offloading some transactions to a standalone blockchain. There are a few different implementations of sidechains, but a common one is to “peg” a sidechain to a parent blockchain. With pegged blockchains, a user on one blockchain can send tokens to an “output address”, and the equivalent amount of tokens will be released onto the sidechain. Pegs are bidirectional, so the user can return to the original blockchain at will. One benefit of sidechains is the increase in capacity for the original blockchain. Since transactions performed on the sidechain are not recorded in the blocks of the main blockchain, the total capacity of the system is increased. Sidechains can also be used to address specific deficiencies of the parent blockchain. For example, a sidechain could have a faster block rate than the parent chain, increasing the system’s transaction speed. Alternatively, sidechains can increase the capabilities of the system, like the Rootstock sidechain that plans to add smart contract functionality to Bitcoin.The main security consideration of sidechains is that the sidechain is a completely distinct system from the main chain. It needs to have its own means of securing consensus, through a large pool of miners, stakers, etc. Otherwise, a hack of the sidechain could affect the quality of its peg with the main chain and its users’ ability to switch back and forth. State Channels Another blockchain extension that has been getting a lot of press is the state channel. The most famous state channel system is probably the Lightning Network running on the Bitcoin network. However, other state channel implementations run on other blockchains under different names. State channels function as a second-level protocol that runs on top of a traditional blockchain implementation. A state channel is a direct connection between users of the blockchain network. They establish the channel using a traditional blockchain transaction that establishes the balance that each has contributed to the channel (i.e. 1 BTC apiece). After the channel is established, payments are made by creating mutually signed assertions regarding the balance of value in the channel (i.e. .75 BTC and 1.25 BTC). The channel can be closed down at any time, and another blockchain transaction is created using the most recent balance assertion to place the correct amount of cryptocurrency in each participant’s blockchain account. The main advantages of state channels are transaction speed, scalability, and privacy. Transactions only require the channel participants and can be completed near-instantaneously. However, if a channel becomes too unbalanced, it may be impossible to make a payment. This is where the network of state channels can be very useful since transactions can pass through different paths to rebalance channels or perform transfers between unconnected parties. The main security consideration of state channels is that transactions are backed by the blockchain but not recorded on it. State channel transactions are private to the recipients, and the blockchain network has to trust that all transactions made over them are legitimate. However, the point-to-point nature of state channels protects against double-spend attacks since the value stored in one channel is unique to that channel and cannot be used to open and perform transactions in other channels. The Distributed Ledger Universe This series was designed to be an introduction to blockchain technology with a focus on blockchain security. However, the solutions discussed in these articles are not the only ones out there. Other distributed ledger implementations (like DAGs and hashgraphs) use different data structures and have different security properties. Also, the blockchain can be extended using external devices that interact via APIs or smart contracts. When designing a distributed ledger solution, it’s important to consider all of the available technology and the security considerations associated with it.

Literally meaning 'hidden writing,' cryptography is a method of hiding and protecting information by using a code, or cipher, only decipherable by its intended recipient. Today, modern cryptography is essential to the secure Internet, corporate cybersecurity, and blockchain technology. However, the earliest use of ciphers dates back to around 100 BC. In this three-part series, we will explore the history of cryptography before the 20th century, in the 20th century, and in the modern day. Historical Cryptography Caesar Box The \"Caesar Box,\" or \"Caesar Cipher,\" is one of the earliest known ciphers. Developed around 100 BC, it was used by Julius Caesar to send secret messages to his generals in the field. In the event that one of his messages got intercepted, his opponent could not read them. This obviously gave him a great strategic advantage. So, what was the code? Caesar shifted each letter of his message three letters to the right to produce what could be called the ciphertext. The ciphertext is what the enemy would see instead of the true message. So, for example, if Caesar’s messages were written in the English alphabet, each letter “A” in the message would become a \"D,\" the \"B’s\" would become \"E’s,\" and the \"X's\" become \"A’s.\" This type of cipher is appropriately called a “shift cipher.” Caesar’s magic number was three, however, a modern day use of the Caesar Cipher is a code called \"ROT13.\" ROT13, short for \"rotate by 13 places,\" shifts each letter of the English alphabet 13 spaces. It is often used in online forums to hide information such as movie and tv show spoilers, solutions to puzzles or games, or offensive material. The code is easily crackable, however, it hides the information from the quick glance. Cryptanalysis: Breaking a Caesar Box The hardest part of breaking a Caesar Box is figuring out the language of the message that it encodes. Once the code cracker figures this out, two scenarios are considered. Either the “attacker” utilizes a technique such as frequency analysis, or they use what is referred to as a brute force attack. In the first instance, the attacker knows that certain letters are used more frequently than others. For example, A,E,O, and T are the most commonly used letters, while Q, X, and Z are the least. The relative frequencies of each letter in the English language are shown in the graph below. If using a simple substitution cipher such as frequency analysis does not crack the code, an attacker could perform a brute force attack. This kind of attack entails testing each possible shift on a small snippet of the message. So, if the message is written in English, this would require a maximum of 26 tests since there are 26 letters in the English alphabet. While this is not a particularly sophisticated attack, it is effective. The Vigenère Cipher The Vigenère Cipher, created in the 16th century, uses an element not found in a Caesar Cipher: a secret key. The creator of the code picks any word or combination of letters at random to be the key, for example, “DOG.” The keyword chosen will then be matched to the plaintext message that you want to encrypt, for example, \"ATTACK.\" You can see that the keyword \"dog\" is shorter than the word “attack\" by three letters. In this case, repeat your key until it matches the number of letters in your plaintext message. In this case, you would then have \"DOGDOG.\" Now, you will be able to create the ciphertext. To do this, you will need to use the chart below. The columns are the letters of the secret key, while the rows are the letters of the plaintext message. So for our example, the first letter of our key is “D,” while the first letter of our plaintext word is “A.” So, find where they intersect on the chart, and you will find the first letter of our ciphertext, which is “D.” Next, the second letters of our key and plaintext words are “O” and “T” respectively. They intersect at “H.” You would continue this until you complete all six letters. Plaintext Message: ATTACKKey: DOGDOGCiphertext: DHZDQQ Cryptanalysis: Cracking a Vigenère Cipher Because of the use of a key, the Vigenère Cipher cannot initially be cracked by using a simple frequency analysis like you could do with a Caesar Cipher. Though, the main weakness of a Vigenère Cipher is the repeating of the key. So, in our example, “dog” was repeated twice in order to match the number of letters in the word “attack.” If an attacker guesses the key’s length, it becomes much easier to crack. The ciphertext is then treated like a series of small Caesar Ciphers, and a method such as frequency analysis could then be performed to crack the code. But how can an attacker guess the length of the key? There are actually two methods: the Kasiski examination and the Friedman test. If the attacker notices that there are repeated segments of text in the ciphertext, a Kasiski examination would be effective in cracking the code. The attacker would count the distance of letters between repeated text to get a good idea of how long the key is. The Friedman test takes an algebraic approach utilizing a formula to measure the unevenness of the cipher letter frequencies to break the cipher. The longer the text, the more accurate this technique is Coming Up: 20th Century Ciphers The Caesar Box and the Vigenère Cipher are two of the earliest known ciphers. They pioneered the use of encryption to protect sensitive communications data and the use of a secret key in encryption. In the next post in this series, we will move forward to the 20th century.

	{"title":"The Story of Cryptography : Modern Cryptography", "text": "The Story of Cryptography : Modern Cryptography ☰ For Individuals For Teams Store Downloads About Us Support Help Contact us 30 DAY FREE TRIAL The Story of Cryptography 1 2 3 Modern Cryptography This is the final post in a three-part series on the history of cryptography. In the first post, we explored encryption algorithms that pioneered some of the core components of encryption: The Caesar Box and the Vigenère Cipher. From there, the second post describes some of the historical cryptographic milestones of the 20th century: the Enigma machine, the Data Encryption Standard (DES), and the invention of asymmetric encryption. In this post, we will explore how cryptography has evolved in the 21st century. Beginning with DES’s replacement, AES, this post explores the use of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) and some of the areas of cryptographic research currently being explored today: homomorphic encryption and post-quantum cryptography. The Advanced Encryption Standard The Data Encryption Standard (DES) was the first encryption algorithm publicly endorsed by the US government. As a result, it was rapidly adopted throughout the United States and beyond. The rapid expansion, though, also brought on a great deal of scrutiny by cryptographers. So, when the DES was defeated in 1997 by a brute-force key guessing attack, it was time for an update that was warmly welcomed by its critics. In 1997, the National Institute of Standards and Technology put out a call for proposals for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). This resulted in the submission of fifteen candidate ciphers from around the world and a three-year selection process. During the selection process, cryptographers debated and attempted to break the various ciphers. Ultimately, three ciphers from the Rijndael family of ciphers (developed by Belgian cryptographers) were selected to be the AES. The Technicalities The three selected variants have a 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit secret key. All three variants use a 128-bit block size (organized into 4 4-byte rows) and multiple rounds. Each round but the last includes four steps: SubBytes: Application of S-Boxes to transform the state ShiftRows: Shifting of the last three rows by 1, 2, or 3 bytes MixColumns: Combination of the four bytes in each column of the state AddRoundKey: Exclusive-or (XOR) of the state with the round key Before the rounds begin, an AddRoundKey operation is performed, and the last round does not include MixColumns. One difference between the different variants is the number of rounds: 10, 12, or 14. The other significant difference is the key schedule used to derive the 128-bit round keys from the 128-bit, 192-bit, or 256-bit secret key. Security of the AES AES is currently considered a secure cipher. The only feasible attack against the full version of AES would use “side-channel analysis,” in which power consumption, electro-magnetic emissions, etc. are measured and used to infer internal values of the state of the cipher. Other attacks against AES either operate on a reduced number of rounds or have a limited effect on the security. The best known attack, thus far, reduces the effective key lengths of the three variants to 126-, 189.9-, and 254.3-bits. However, all of these key lengths are still infeasible to brute-force on modern computing hardware. Therefore, AES is still considered to be secure. Elliptic Curve Cryptography In the previous post in this series, we discussed the invention of asymmetric encryption and how algorithms using it are still considered secure. However, the security of these algorithms is based upon the key length used. As computing improves, brute force attacks on longer keys become feasible, forcing a move to even larger secret keys. Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) provides a limited solution to this problem. Simply put, an elliptic curve is a plane algebraic curve created by an non-singular equation - meaning, when drawn, the curve never intersects itself. If a line on the curve intersects two points in the curve, it will always intersects a third. This third point represents the public key. Every point on the curve (at the x and y coordinates) satisfies an equation. Furthermore, addition of two points on an elliptic curve is equivalent to multiplication of two integers, and exponentiation in the integers is equivalent to multiplication of points on an elliptic curve. As a result, it is possible to construct the same “hard” mathematical problems used in asymmetric cryptography using elliptic curves. The benefit of using elliptic curve cryptography instead of traditional integer-based algorithms like RSA and D-H, is an increased level of security with shorter key lengths. According to NIST, a 256-bit ECC private key provides equivalent security to a 3072-bit RSA key. ECC-based asymmetric algorithms also consume less energy than their integer-based counterparts, making them more efficient and usable as well. However, the security advantages of ECC only apply to brute force attacks exploiting key lengths. The ECC algorithms use the same underlying mathematical “hard” problems as RSA and D-H, meaning that an attacker who finds an “easy” solution to these “hard” problems can attack ECC-based encryption as well. Next-Gen Cryptography The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Elliptic Curve Cryptography are in common use today, but they are largely “solved” problems. Some of the cryptographic algorithms currently in development today, like homomorphic encryption and post-quantum cryptography, are designed to expand the applications of cryptography or solve problems created by improvements in computing systems. Homomorphic Encryption Modern cryptography works very well at protecting sensitive data against attacks with modern systems. However, it has one very significant shortcoming: you cannot process encrypted data. Adding or multiplying the ciphertexts of two AES-encrypted values does not produce the sum or product of their corresponding plaintexts. This means that data must be decrypted in order to be processed, and encryption only protects data at rest and data in transit. Homomorphic encryption is designed to change this. A fully homomorphic encryption algorithm allows the user to perform arbitrary computations on a ciphertext and then decrypt the result to the correct plaintext (with all computations applied). The first fully homomorphic encryption algorithm was proposed by Craig Gentry in his 2009 PhD thesis. Since then, the first use has been actively expanded by Gentry and others to help improve the efficiency, security, and usability of FHE algorithms. Post-Quantum Cryptography Another area that is getting a lot of attention in the cryptography space is that of post-quantum cryptography. In previous posts, we discussed how asymmetric encryption is based upon mathematical “hard” problems. With these problems, legitimate operations (multiplication and exponentiation) are polynomially difficult, but their inverses (factoring and logarithms) have a difficulty that grows exponentially with the length of the numbers used. This asymmetry allows asymmetric cryptosystems to be developed that are usable but can achieve an arbitrary level of security against attack. However, this only works if these problems remain “hard.” An algorithm, developed by Peter Shor in 1994, makes it possible for quantum computers to break this assumption. When quantum computers grow powerful enough, traditional asymmetric encryption will be broken. In anticipation of this day, cryptographers are actively developing “post-quantum asymmetric cryptography algorithms.” These algorithms are based on mathematical problems that are “hard” for quantum computers as well. Several of these problems and algorithms exist, but there is still active research in the field to develop new ones and test existing ones. This is to ensure that secure alternatives are available when traditional asymmetric cryptography “breaks.” Wrapping Up The goal of this three-part series is to provide an introduction to the history of cryptography. Beginning with historical ciphers, moving to 20th century encryption systems, and concluding with modern cryptographic algorithms, this series highlights the inventions with the greatest impact on the cryptographic algorithms that we use today.

This included the development and use of the Caesar Box and the Vigenère Cipher, encryption algorithms that pioneered the use of encryption as well as the advent of the encryption key. It wasn’t until the 20th century that cryptography came into widespread use. Notable encryption milestones from the 20th century include the development and use of the Enigma machine, the creation of the US Data Encryption Standard (DES), and the development of asymmetric encryption. The Enigma Machine The Enigma machine is arguably the most famous encryption device to date. It was developed by Arthur Scherbius in 1918 at the end of WWI. The Enigma uses a rotor mechanism and special wiring to scramble the alphabet to easily and quickly create ciphertext from plaintext or vice versa. When in use, one person types the message on the keyboard, while a second person writes down which letters light up on the light board directly above the keyboard. For example, you may type an \"O\" on the keyboard, but the \"E\" may light up on the light board. However, if you type \"O\" a second time, perhaps a \"T\" might light up. If you are typing the plaintext message on the keyboard, the letters from the light board would be the ciphertext or vice versa. But how does it work? The rotor mechanism changes the electrical connections between the keys and the lights with each keypress. To remain secure, the settings on the machine were changed daily based on secret key lists distributed in advance. The receiving station had to know and use the exact settings employed by the transmitting station to successfully decrypt a message. Decryption was accomplished via the same process. The Enigma machines were infamously used by the Germans in WWII to encrypt radio communications, but versions were also employed by the Japanese and Italians as well. Cryptanalysis: Cracking the German Code Breaking the encryption of the Enigma machine was a multistage process. The model in use by the Germans had cryptographic vulnerabilities which ultimately allowed a Polish cryptanalyst, Marian Rejewski, to crack the encryption keys in use. However, he did not have knowledge of the internal wiring of the machines, so he was not able to use this knowledge to break the codes. This information was actually obtained by a French spy, Hans-Thilo Schmidt, along with all of the codes used for encryption during September and October of 1932. Using the newly obtained ciphertexts from this period, the Polish were able to build a working Enigma machine and decrypt German communications in three short months. This began a \"cat and mouse game\" between the Germans and the Polish until 1938, when German improvements made decryption too resource-intensive for the Polish to maintain. In July of the following year, the Polish disclosed their Enigma decryption efforts to French and British military intelligence. This partnership allowed the British to develop their Enigma decryption efforts at Bletchley Park and continue decryption of German communications for the rest of the war. Lucifer: The Data Encryption Standard Before the early 1970’s, the use of cryptography was primarily restricted to military use. However, in 1971, the first encryption algorithms for private-use were published. By this time, companies had seen the effectiveness of encryption and were interested in applying it to the protection of their own intellectual property. The first set of civilian encryption algorithms were developed by IBM under the name \"Lucifer.\" Several different versions were created by IBM, one of which they submitted to the US National Bureau of Standards in hopes of getting it accepted as the national Data Encryption Standard (DES). The version they submitted was initially vulnerable to \"differential cryptanalysis,\" but after some modifications done by the National Security Agency (NSA), IBM’s Lucifer was indeed accepted as the Data Encryption Standard The accepted version was a \"Feistel network,\" which is a multi-round encryption algorithm whose structure is shown in the images below. The image on the right shows the operations that would be performed in each of the left image’s boxes labeled “F\" (for Feistel function). So, the message undergoes a permutation at the beginning of the encryption process and at the end of the encryption process (boxes \"IP\" and \"FP\"), as well as during each round of the Feistel function (the green box labeled \"P\"). Getting technical, the \"E\" box in the right image represents an expansion of the half-block from 32- to 48-bits, while each of the numbered \"S\" boxes represents a substitution table that reduces 6 input bits to 4 output bits. The cipher also has a key schedule, which generates 16 48-bit round keys from the original 56-bit secret key. Brute-Force Attack on the Data Encryption Standard As mentioned, the NSA made several different modifications to the Lucifer cipher before it was accepted as the DES. Some modifications, like changing the S-Boxes to protect against differential cryptanalysis, were designed to improve the security of the cipher. Others, like changing the key length from 128-bits to 56-bits, may have been designed to ensure that the NSA still had the ability to break the cipher if needed. Ultimately, Lucifer, or the DES, was not broken due to cryptographic vulnerabilities, but instead by a brute force attack that took advantage of the limited key space. DES was first broken in 1997, acting as the catalyst for the advent of the Advanced Encryption Standard. Asymmetric Encryption The original encryption algorithms used are called \"symmetric encryption algorithms.\" These types of systems require both the sender and the recipient of a message to both have access to the same encryption key. The users are required to set up a secure channel in order to transmit this key before encryption can begin. However, in the 1970’s, the invention of \"asymmetric cryptography\" changed this. Asymmetric cryptography, or public key cryptography, uses both a public and a private key in order to encrypt or decrypt data. The keys are typically two large strings of numbers paired together. One key is public, and can be shared with anyone, the other is the private key which is kept secret. If the private key is used to encrypt a message, you would use the public key for decryption and vice versa. The one-way functions used in most asymmetric cryptography are called \"factorization\" and \"discrete logarithm problem.\" Technically speaking, the security of these schemes relies on the fact that operations like multiplication and exponentiation are \"easy\" (with polynomial difficulty), and the inverse operations, factoring and logarithms, are \"hard\" (with exponential difficulty). Asymmetric encryption algorithms are designed to allow legitimate users to perform \"easy\" operations while forcing attackers to solve \"hard\" problems. The UK’s Government Communication Headquarters’ (GCHQ) cryptographers originally developed asymmetric cryptography in the early 1970’s, though, their results and algorithms remained classified until 1997. The algorithms were independently discovered by private researchers and are named after these parties. The original key exchange protocol, called D-H, was invented by Malcolm J. Williamson of GCHQ in 1974, but is named after Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman, who discovered it in 1976. The RSA algorithm for asymmetric encryption and decryption was discovered by Clifford Cocks in 1973. A more general version was invented by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman in 1976. Since then, several different asymmetric encryption algorithms have been invented. Coming Up: 20th Century Ciphers The encryption algorithms presented in this article are largely broken, with the exception of the asymmetric algorithms D-H and RSA. However, even the security of these algorithms are threatened by advances in computers. The final post in this series describes some of the modern encryption algorithms currently in use or development that are designed to replace these algorithms as they are broken.
